Ensuring Bunch Stability in Multi-MW Beams
Dr. Robert Ainsworth, Associate Scientist
Accelerator Division
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
Successful delivery of intensity frontier science at Fermilab requires Mega-Watt (MW)
class particle beams. For these beams to be delivered reliably and with minimal losses, it is
essential that the particle bunches remain stable. The transverse mode coupling instability (TMCI)
is known to be one of the main intensity limitations for bunch stability in circular machines. For
many years, space charge (the repulsive forces between particles inside a bunch) was thought to
have a stabilizing effect on TMCI raising the instability threshold to higher intensities. However,
recent advances in the theoretical understanding of beam stability in the presence of strong
space charge, has suggested a new class of instabilities known as convective instabilities. It is
paramount that these instabilities are understood to ensure bunch stability in multi-MW beams.
To tackle this problem, the research will involve an experimental program making use of
Fermilab's existing accelerator complex, along with a set of complementary simulations. The
research will characterize these instabilities in the presence of varying space charge and wake
amplitudes. Usually, the wake amplitudes which drive instabilities are machine dependent and
are determined by the impedance of the components installed within the machine. A novel
approach to control instabilities will be to install a `waker' system, a dedicated wake-building
feedback system. Once the instabilities are excited, they will be observed and measured using an
intra-bunch motion monitor (IBM). The IBM will be able to resolve the transverse motion within
the bunch and measure the growth rates and amplification factors of instabilities.

Discovery Science with New Multi-modal Pixel-based Noble Element Time Projection
Chambers
Dr. Jonathan Asaadi, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
The University of Texas at Arlington
Arlington, TX 76019
High Energy Physics (HEP) has long been a tool-driven field with discoveries enabled by
breakthroughs in instrumentation. Large scale noble element time projection chambers (TPCs)
play a central role in many HEP experiments and offer an opportunity to perform discovery level
measurements through the enhancement of their capabilities. Detectors using noble elements,
such as liquid and gaseous argon and xenon, have risen to become a prime technology used to:
i) pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass, ii) search for new physics of dark matter,
and iii) explore the unknown in searches for new particles and interactions. In a noble element
TPC, particles interact with the medium and deposit their energy into three main channels: heat,
charge, and light. Depending on the physics of interest, noble element detectors attempt to
exploit one or more of these signal components. The objective of this research is to transform
the physics reach of these instruments and develop new detection strategies to expand their
capabilities to previously inaccessible regimes. To realize this challenge requires unambiguous
3D readout of the charge, maximum sensitivity to the full spectrum of light produced, and ideally
having these capabilities integrated into a single sensor. This research undertakes this endeavor
to realize such a detector through the exploration of low power pixel-based charge readout and
research into novel light detection techniques utilizing various new materials. The penultimate
outcome of this work is the integration of these two lines of research into an integrated readout
device capable of detecting both the light and charge produced in noble element TPCs. If realized
the outcome of this research, to quote Galileo, will be to ''measure what is measurable, and make
measurable what is not so'' with the full capabilities of noble element TPCs.

Gold Catalyzed Polymerization Reactions of Unsaturated Substrates:
Towards New Functional, Recyclable, and Upcycled Aromatic Polymers
Dr. Jason Azoulay, Assistant Professor
School of Polymer Science and Engineering
University of Southern Mississippi
Hattiesburg, MS 39406
Aromatic polymers constitute a ubiquitous class of commodity and specialty “plastics”
given that aromatic and pseudo-aromatic rings in the polymer backbone impart robust
mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. There remains a pressing need to create new
technologies that cannot be accommodated within the scope of traditional polymerization
reactions, that revolutionize the lifecycle of plastics, utilize unusable industrial and consumer
waste, and which reduce environmental impacts. This proposal describes a research program
with the goal of developing new patterns of catalytic reactivity and methods for the synthesis of
aromatic polymers using Homogeneous Gold (Au) Catalysis (HGC). Synthetic strategies will be
developed to polymerize monomers based on unsaturated precursors and access novel
polymeric materials through the extension of Au catalyzed intermolecular processes. Specific
objectives of this research include: (1) to extend Au catalyzed intermolecular reactions to
bifunctional monomers; (2) to gain fundamental mechanistic insight into Au-catalyzed
polymerizations; (3) to apply these reactions to the synthesis of new classes of aromatic polymers
that can be readily and/or selectively deconstructed; and (4) to apply these chemistries to the
upcycling of post-industrial plastics and post-consumer waste. These results will provide many of
the first examples of HGC in the field of polymer science and provide the foundational knowledge
needed to design new chemical reactions, catalysts, processes, and materials. In turn, this will
enable efficient chemical syntheses from commercial feedstocks which are currently unusable,
new depolymerization approaches for circular processing, and chemical upcycling strategies.

Transport of Complex Mixtures in Ion-Containing Polymer Membranes
Dr. Bryan Beckingham, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical Engineering
Auburn University
Auburn, AL 36849
This research aims to improve the understanding of multi-solute transport behavior
within ion-containing polymer membranes. Permselective ion-containing membranes are
integral to many energy applications from water treatment, fuel cells, and solar fuels devices
where the selective transport of molecules and ions is desired. In solar fuels devices, for example,
ion-containing polymer membranes are responsible for permitting selective transport of ions
between electrodes to maintain overall charge neutrality, yet limit transport of reaction products
produced at the electrodes. While the transport of single solutes through such membranes has
been well described, binary and multicomponent transport is poorly understood due to the
myriad of interactions that occur in these systems (i.e. between co-permeants and between
permeants and the membrane). This is just one of many cases where understanding the transport
of multiple simultaneous species is critically important to limiting product crossover that reduces
performance.
This experimental project includes the synthesis of ion exchange membranes with varied
incorporation of comonomers (ionic and neutral moieties) in order to investigate fundamental
relationships between membrane structure, membrane physiochemical properties, and
transport behavior of solutes and complex solute mixtures through dense, hydrated membranes.
The project leverages an in situ spectroscopic methodology to perform multi-component
diffusion cell experiments with high fidelity which greatly reduces the experimental burden and
complexity compared to traditional multicomponent experiments. The impact of the
physicochemical properties of the synthesized polymer membranes on the multicomponent,
emergent transport properties are evaluated. This investigation elucidates key structure-
property relationships and hence advances the development of robust membranes with desired
transport behavior. A key research focus is on the interplay of membrane chemistry and complex
mixture chemistry on emergent transport behavior. Experimental tasks in this project are
expected to result in (1) fabrication of a diverse set of ion exchange membranes with a variety of
chemical composition, water uptake, and ionic conductivity, (2) experimental characterization of
the transport behavior of solutes and their complex mixtures, and (3) new understanding of the
relationships between membrane chemistry and transport behavior of solutes and their complex
mixtures. This has the potential to impact the future design of ion containing polymer
membranes for a range of applications including energy devices, water purification, and the
separation of other complex mixtures.

Manipulating Interfacial Reactivity with Atomically Layered Heterostructures
Dr. D. Kwabena Bediako, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of California, Berkeley
Berkeley, CA 94720
Tailoring chemical reactions at electrified solid–liquid interfaces requires surfaces that are
both well-defined and highly tunable. The key basic science challenge entails control over the
density and structure of participating electronic states in the solid, as well as the alignment of
this electronic band with molecular energies of reactant species. Unlike traditional bulk materials
in which the chemically active surface represents only some fraction of the total material,
individual layers of atomically thin, so-called “two-dimensional” materials are essentially all
surface. As a result, their physical properties are exceptionally tunable by marginal structural and
electrostatic perturbations. Drawing on emerging insights for manipulating the physics of these
quantum materials, this research aims to develop the fundamental knowledge and materials
required to control the interfacial chemistry of electrochemical reactions at a molecular level.
The advances that emerge from this program will establish a new design framework for the
interconversion of electrical energy and chemical energy. These principles hold promise for next-
generation energy technologies, particularly the electrically-driven transformation of abundant,
low energy materials into important high energy chemicals and fuels.

A Neutral-atom Quantum Simulator for Nuclear Physics
Dr. Michael Bishof, Assistant Physicist
Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Quantum devices are poised to have a transformational impact on nuclear physics
because they present an opportunity to solve significant problems that are intractable for
classical computers. Such problems lie at the heart of nuclear physics: to fundamentally
understand how properties of nucleons and nuclei emerge from the underlying theory of
quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While general purpose quantum computers have
demonstrated rapid progress in recent years, they are still many years away from addressing
these challenges. To accelerate the impact of quantum information science on nuclear physics,
this research will develop a quantum simulator that is tailored to address specific challenges in
this field. In contrast to a quantum computer, which maps each problem to a set of standard
operations on quantum bits, a quantum simulator manipulates an experimental apparatus to
behave like the system under investigation. Quantum simulators can be extremely powerful tools
for discovery when they efficiently reproduce key characteristics from the system of interest. This
research will leverage neutral ytterbium atoms trapped in reconfigurable optical tweezer arrays
to simulate quark-level effective theories for QCD. This experimental platform offers resource-
efficient simulations of a simplified but rich theoretical framework, which will enable more rapid
progress toward simulations of poorly understood phenomena in nuclear physics and inform
future simulations of more complex theories as quantum devices improve.

in Chlorophyll Biosynthesis
Dr. Jennifer Bridwell-Rabb, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
With a growing population to sustain and increasing demands for food and energy, it is
vital that we determine ways to accommodate an increasing infrastructure without sacrificing
our environment. The ability of photosynthetic organisms to efficiently extract energy from
sunlight and transform CO into sugars and/or evolve hydrogen shows promise for both
2
enhancing our food supply and decreasing our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels. However,
several limitations exist towards realizing the potential of photosynthetic organisms in these
applications or emulating them in man-made technologies. Namely, there is a large fundamental
knowledge gap regarding how photosynthetic organisms naturally survive in habitats that receive
different amounts of light and O , both of which profoundly affect their growth and survival.
2
Therefore, this research will detail fundamental biochemical mechanisms that photosynthetic
organisms use to produce the essential photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and
bacteriochlorophyll, under variable amounts of light and O . Towards these goals, the research
2
will (i) resolve clear mechanistic deficits about how photosynthetic pigments are built and
tailored in the presence and absence of O , (ii) describe how pigment biosynthetic enzymes
2
coordinate with one another to maintain pigment production, and (iii) investigate evolutionary
changes that have occurred in photosynthetic pigment-producing enzymes in response to
changing environmental conditions.

Theory-informed Artificial Intelligence for Accelerating Materials Characterization
Dr. Maria Chan, Scientist
Center for Nanoscale Materials
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Improvements in the capability to capture, convert, and store energy hinge heavily on the
understanding and control of existing materials to inform the design of new ones. Such
understanding depends on precise knowledge of the atomic and electronic structures of
materials during synthesis and operation. At DOE Scientific User Facilities, multi-modal x-ray,
electron, laser, and scanning probes, as well as computational modeling tools, have now become
indispensable in providing complementary atomic-scale information. However, determining
where the atoms are from scattering, microscopy, spectroscopy, or computational modeling data
remains a substantial challenge. The goal of this project is to use a theory-informed artificial
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) framework to allow researchers to determine atomic
positions in real-time from experimental characterization data, via a user-friendly toolkit titled
FANTASTX (Fully Automated Nanoscale To Atomistic Structure from Theory and eXperiment).
Implementing the FANTASTX framework involves developing and connecting approaches for the
simulation of x-ray, electron, laser, and scanning probe data; adopting and applying pattern
recognition and computer vision algorithms for the matching of spectra and images; and
constructing and training ML models for the relationship between spectroscopic data and the
local atomic environment. FANTASTX incorporates physics into AI/ML by using theory to provide
physical constraints towards the sampling of the infinitely large space of atomic arrangements.
FANTASTX will allow the real-time determination of atomic-scale structural information during
experimentation, which will in turn enable and accelerate nanoscale materials understanding
and design.

Modeling the Nucleosynthetic Imprint of Stellar Merger Phenomena
Dr. Manos Chatzopoulos, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy
Louisiana State University
Baton Rouge, LA 70803
It is now accepted that the majority of stars - especially massive stars - in the Milky Way
galaxy are in binary systems. The evolution of such systems is much more complex than the
evolution of single stars due to the interactions occurring between the stars in the binary that is
capable of altering their overall properties (such as their size, composition and rotation rate). In
extreme cases, many of these systems will be unstable and will in-spiral and dynamically merge.
These stellar mergers are associated by a burst of electromagnetic radiation - a “mergeburst” -
accompanied by the ejection of some material while leaving behind a post-merger remnant star
with potentially unusual chemical composition, high rotation and, in some cases, enhanced
magnetism. This - likely more massive - remnant will eventually end its life as a supernova
explosion within a complex circumstellar environment produced by the past merger, leading to
an interaction between the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar material and, potentially, to
a very luminous transient. In tandem, the merger-induced nuclear burning that will occur may
significantly affect the surface chemical properties of these stars as compared to stars that did
not suffer a merger. This first-ever complete numerical simulation campaign spans all the phases
associated with stellar merger phenomena: the pre-merger evolution of the binary, the
dynamical binary merger and mergeburst transient and the short and long-term nuclear
processes in the merger and the remnant star via the use of large supercomputers. The resulting
simulations will elucidate observations taken with some of the most powerful telescopes and will
enable a more complete understanding of an important class of astrophysical transient events as
well as the nuclear astrophysics associated with them.

Expanding Capabilities to Unlock the Mysteries of Complex Warm Dense Matter
Dr. Federica Coppari, Research Scientist
Physics Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
Understanding the properties of Warm Dense Matter—the elusive state of matter
between hot solids and strongly correlated cold plasmas—is one of the grand challenges of High
Energy Density science. Extreme densities and temperatures induce dramatic changes in the
physical and chemical properties of materials in this regime, including structural and electronic
phase transformations and the emergence of new states of matter. The advances in ultra-fast
laser-driven compression techniques and the development of dynamic compression platforms at
x-ray user facilities worldwide (X-ray Free Electron Lasers and synchrotron sources) is a revolution
that now enables a new class of experiments to investigate the physics of matter at extreme
conditions with unprecedented precision. This research will focus on unraveling the mixing
properties of complex compounds with an emphasis on understanding the behavior of planetary
constituent materials. This project will expand the current experimental capabilities pulling
together ultra-fast X-Ray Diffraction and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure combined
with optical diagnostics to unravel the complex transformations happening at extreme conditions
of pressure, temperature and timescale. This project will also investigate the atomistic pathways
to structural phase transitions, elucidating kinetic and metastability effects arising at ultra-fast
compression. This research will present opportunities for discoveries with transformational
impact on a range of fields from High Energy Density to planetary science.

Atomic View of Molecular Photocatalysis using X-Ray Lasers
Dr. Amy Cordones-Hahn, Staff Scientist
Stanford PULSE Institute
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, CA 94025
Molecular photocatalysts have the potential to deliver an alternative sustainable method
to produce fuels or other value-added chemicals using solar energy. Identifying the molecular
properties that influence their reactivity is a critical first step to creating new and efficient
photocatalysts. This research program aims to pinpoint and control the electronic excited state
reaction pathways of transition metal complex photocatalysts. Nickel-based hydrogen-evolving
catalysts with ‘non-innocent’ ligands, known to actively participate in the electron and proton
transfer reactions of the catalyst, will serve as platforms to identify how catalyst charge
distribution influences the excited state character and reaction mechanism. Achieving the
ultimate goal of controlling photocatalytic reactivity first requires the ability to identify and
manipulate the excited state charge distribution, relaxation mechanism, and geometry of the
reaction site, which may involve metal or ligand atoms. These requirements inform the technical
approach of this research, which exploits the atomic specificity and ultrafast time-resolution of
X-ray spectroscopy at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free electron laser. Ultrafast
X-ray spectroscopy probing metal and ligand atomic sites will be used to map the excited state
charge distributions, determine the transient catalyst structures, and differentiate the
mechanistic roles of metal vs. ligand reactive sites. Through these experiments, this research will
establish 1) how catalyst excited states initiate electron and proton transfer reactions, 2) the
specific role of metal vs. ligand atom reactive sites, and 3) how to use ligand composition to
influence critical excited state properties and reactivity. This novel approach using ultrafast X-ray
methods to identify excited state reaction pathways and inform catalyst design will lead to new
classes of molecular photocatalysts that efficiently convert solar energy to high value chemicals.

Probing lanmodulin's Mechanisms of Rare-Earth Selectivity for Protein-Based Bioseparations
Dr. Joseph Cotruvo, Assistant Professor of Chemistry
Department of Chemistry
Pennsylvania State University
University Park, PA 16802
This project addresses the challenge of separating rare earth elements (REEs) from one
another and from other ions, using Nature’s solutions to this problem as guides. REEs are
ubiquitous components of current technologies from permanent magnets and lasers to medical
imaging agents. Separations of REEs from more abundant metals and from each other in mining
and recycling applications is currently a laborious, energy- and resource-intensive process using
relatively low-selectivity ligands. Increasing efficiency of these separations has the potential to
lower costs, decrease waste, and allow usage of feedstocks with lower REE concentrations.
The recent discovery and characterization of lanmodulin (LanM), a highly selective REE-
binding protein, forms the basis of this research. LanM has an intriguing framework in which to
understand the fundamentals of the biological coordination chemistry of lanthanide ions;
preliminary data also indicate that it is a protein with remarkable stability properties that enable
it to quantitatively extract total REEs from industrially relevant feedstocks even under harsh
experimental conditions. Although LanM displays exceedingly high selectivity for REEs versus
non-REEs, its selectivity within the REEs is rather low. The present research program will utilize a
multidisciplinary approach to develop LanM variants with higher intra-REE selectivities for REE
separations. Whereas small molecules, materials, and whole cells have been explored for
separations, effective macromolecular approaches are conspicuously absent. The promising
performance, stability, affinity, and selectivity of LanM suggest that this protein and its
derivatives may serve as guides for new and efficient approaches to REE separations.

Coupled Effects of Stress and Hydrogen on Stress Corrosion Cracking of Fe-based Alloys
Dr. Arun Devaraj, Staff Scientist
Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
Hydrogen is the most abundant and the simplest element in the Universe. Yet, it exhibits
complex behaviors because of its ability to donate all of its electrons or to double their number,
depending on the environment. The rich variety of H-induced processes is responsible for
catastrophic failures of structural materials through hydrogen-assisted cracking, even in high-
strength steels. When steel is subjected simultaneously to an applied tensile stress and a
corrosive, high-temperature aqueous medium, interplay of hydrogen and oxygen interactions
with the alloy microstructure are thought to lead to intergranular stress corrosion cracking (SCC).
Due to the low atomic mass and fast diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, the hydrogen
concentration and distribution, as well as its effect on local oxidation and stress-induced
deformation, are extremely challenging to analyze in a quantitative, spatially resolved manner at
the atomic scale. The overarching goal of this research is to develop a predictive mechanistic
understanding of how hydrogen, coupled with applied stress and intergranular oxidation, drives
propagation of SCC in Fe-based alloys. This project will use a broad range of tools available at
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and U.S. Department of Energy synchrotron facilities. A
combination of cryogenic-transfer atom probe tomography, in situ electron microscopy,
synchrotron X-ray methods, and atomistic to continuum simulations will be used to obtain
mechanistic insight into how individual diffusion and oxidation events underpin mesoscale SCC
behavior. This work will provide the scientific basis for tailoring the microstructure of metallic
alloys used in nuclear and automotive applications to control the impact of coupled extreme
environments of corrosion, stress, and temperature.

Real-Time Artificial Intelligence for Particle Reconstruction and Higgs Physics
Dr. Javier Duarte, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
The Regents of the University of California – UCSD
La Jolla, CA 92093
With the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s
highest-energy particle accelerator complex, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN) in Switzerland, scientists have acquired an important tool to study the fundamental
building blocks of the universe. Precision measurements of Higgs bosons produced with large
momentum allow for unique insights into the structure of the interactions of the Higgs boson
with other particles that may shed light on physics beyond the Standard Model. While
experimentally challenging, exploring such interactions with novel artificial intelligence (AI)
methods can advance our understanding of the Higgs sector, including the Higgs boson’s self-
interaction. Moreover, today the LHC is undergoing a major upgrade to further increase its
particle collision rate and thereby operate for an additional decade. The experimental detectors
at the upgraded facility must process at least a factor of ten more data at rates of hundreds of
terabytes per second all under challenging conditions. New AI techniques are required to
reconstruct and select, or trigger on, the most physics-sensitive events in real-time to handle the
resulting avalanche of data. The proposed research will achieve the goals of the LHC program at
the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment by developing a sub-microsecond event
reconstruction system using real-time AI algorithms that employ field-programmable gate array
technologies. By harnessing sophisticated AI techniques, this research focuses on measuring the
production of Higgs bosons at large momentum while enhancing particle reconstruction methods
in the trigger. Overall, the proposed research has broader implications for the use of AI in
resource-constrained, low-latency embedded applications across all fields of science.

A Rapid Membrane-based Approach for Medical Isotope Purification
Dr. Christine E. Duval, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Case Western Reserve University
Cleveland, OH 44106
Radiopharmaceuticals are widely used in diagnostic medical imaging and have great
potential in other medical applications such as localized radiotherapy and theranostics
(simultaneous therapy and diagnostic imaging); however, wide-spread use of these
nontraditional radiotherapies has been restricted by their availability. The overall goal of the
proposed research is to increase the availability of medical isotopes for fundamental research
and clinical trials which requires transformative change from current production and purification
methods. Resin-based chromatography is the current state of the art purification scheme and is
known to suffer from diffusion limitations resulting in long-purification times and large column
volumes to achieve sufficient product recovery. Current resins are prepared by physisorbing
extractive ligands into a polyacrylic ester resin. Ligands can leach from these unstable resins
overtime and contaminate the final product. Membrane chromatography is a promising
alternative to resin-based chromatography because it is not diffusion limited and membranes are
synthesized with covalently bound polymeric ligands. Practically, membranes are a chemically
stable alternative to resins in which product recovery is not a function of flowrate. In this work,
we propose the fundamental studies necessary to understand how to design membrane adsorber
architecture and surface chemistry in order to (1) reduce radioisotope purification time from
hours to seconds; (2) minimize elution volumes; and (3) provide a chemically pure product.
Ultimately, the fundamental knowledge generated as a result of this proposal will lay the
foundation for new radiochromatography processes that will increase the US supply of medical
isotopes.

Infective Viruses and Inert Virions: Illuminating Abundant Unknowns in Terrestrial
Biogeochemical Cycles
Dr. Joanne B. Emerson, Assistant Professor
Department of Plant Pathology
University of California, Davis
Davis, CA 95616
Soil viruses have been recognized as highly abundant but virtually unknown members of
the soil microbiome. By infecting soil microbes, viruses likely have substantial, as-yet unknown
impacts on terrestrial biogeochemical processes under their hosts’ control. Viral particles
(virions) may also play more direct roles in soil biogeochemical cycling as packets of carbon,
nitrogen, and phosphorous, but the time scales and environmental conditions that determine
virion infectivity, transport, and/or sorption to soil particles are unknown. This project will use a
combination of laboratory and computational approaches to distinguish between infective and
degraded virions and assess their respective contributions to soil biogeochemical cycling. Using
a multi-omics approach, this research will establish spatiotemporal patterns in soil viral
community composition and virus-host dynamics in forests, chaparrals, grasslands, and wetlands.
In order to identify feedbacks between soil viruses and carbon dynamics in additional, changing
environments, planned research includes field experiments after a high-temperature prescribed
forest fire as well as in a boreal forest ecosystem, leveraging the US Department of Energy’s
Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. By
integrating the knowledge gained in the analysis of these different environmental conditions over
time, this project will expand our understanding of the global soil virosphere and its influence on
global biogeochemical cycles.

Probing Ultrafast XUV/X-ray Induced Electron Correlation in the Molecular Frame
Dr. Li Fang, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Central Florida
Orlando, FL 32816
Electron-electron correlation is ubiquitous in many natural and artificial processes. The
consequent energy and angular momentum exchanges among multiple electrons initiate
chemical processes and play a determining role in photochemical reactions. Being an essential
interaction mechanism in many-body systems, electron correlation determines much of the
structure and dynamics of molecules and composes one of the main themes in quantum
chemistry. This group behavior of multiple electrons, critical to macroscopic material properties
as well, occurs at the microscopic level within an extremely short period of time – attoseconds
(1 attosecond = 10-18 second). With recent advances in attosecond laser technologies, the
dynamics of electron correlation can now be probed directly in the time-domain, unveiling how
the multielectron interaction evolves and can be possibly controlled. This project investigates the
dynamics of electron correlation in molecules in their natural coordinates – the molecular frame.
It also investigates the correlation between the multielectron interaction and the subsequent ion
dynamics and the influence of molecular intrinsic properties and laser parameters on electron
correlation. Extreme ultraviolet (XUV)/x-ray attosecond pulses and techniques of transient
molecular alignment and electron-ion coincidence measurement will be applied to induce
electron correlation and to time-resolve the dynamics with complete kinematic information.
Data gathered in these studies will unambiguously reveal the dependence on the electronic
structure of molecules, on the angle of the molecular axis with respect to the polarization of the
external electromagnetic field, and on externally controllable laser parameters. This research will
provide the fundamental basis for structural, geometrical, and photo-control of multielectron
interactions.

Precipitate Stability and Helium Trapping in Advanced Steels
Dr. Kevin G. Field, Associate Professor
Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences Department
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
2355 Bonisteel Blvd.
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
It is estimated that over 10,000 tons of steel will be used in the construction of a civilian
fusion energy device. The continued safe operation and utility of a fusion energy device will, in
part, rely on the structural integrity of the steel-manufactured components used within its
design. These components could see unique operating conditions, including a damaging flux of
neutrons that alter the structure and chemistry of the steel components. The neutron flux creates
both atomic displacements and helium via a transmutation reaction in the steels. The aim of this
research is to understand how various regimes of the neutron flux will impact the response of
advanced steels with innovative nanometric particle (e.g. precipitate) additions within its matrix.
Specifically, the influence of the precipitate-matrix stability under a damaging energetic particle
flux on the helium migration, coalescence, and trapping will be evaluated. The approach will use
dual beam ion irradiations to experimentally simulate the various neutron damage and
transmutation conditions in a model advanced steel developed using computational
thermodynamics and printed using additive manufacturing. Post irradiation, the changes in
structure and chemistry will be assessed using an extensive characterization campaign using
electron-microscopy based techniques. The experimental efforts will be coupled with advanced
computer analysis algorithms and theoretical models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms
that control precipitate stability and helium trapping in advanced steels. The work will provide
the additional fundamental insights needed to optimize the design and manufacturing of
advanced steels for fusion energy systems.

before they decay to neutrinos. The number of neutrinos in the LBNF neutrino beam is not
precisely understood, primarily because of the complex nuclear physics that governs the creation
of charged particles in the target. The goal of this research program is to provide an extremely
precise measurement of the number of neutrinos in the LBNF neutrino beam. This will be done
using two experiments designed to measure charged particles created when generating neutrino
beams: the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN and the EMPHATIC experiment at Fermilab.
NA61/SHINE will make measurements of charged particles created in the target using replicas of
the LBNF target. EMPHATIC will be used in combination with a replica setup of a neutrino beam
target and focusing horn for the first precise measurement of particles exiting a neutrino beam
focusing horn. Combined, these measurements will provide an unprecedented picture of
accelerator-based neutrino beams and expand the possibilities for new physics discoveries at
DUNE.

Probing Short-Range Structure and Magnetism in Next-Generation Energy Conversion
Materials
Dr. Benjamin Frandsen, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
Brigham Young University
Provo, UT 84602
Next-generation materials will play a crucial role in transformative technologies that can
address critical societal issues, such as the need to harness, store, and convert energy in a
sustainable way. Many candidate materials for technological application derive their exceptional
properties from the complex interplay between their atomic and magnetic structures on short,
nanometer length scales. However, probing structural features on such a short length scale has
historically been a difficult undertaking because conventional methods lack the required
sensitivity. This project overcomes that challenge by using advanced neutron scattering methods
and other complementary techniques to study three classes of materials with significant
technological potential: (1) Magnetic thermoelectrics, in which magnetic properties can enhance
the ability to convert thermal gradients into electrical energy via the thermoelectric effect; (2)
magnetocalorics, which enable magnetic control of thermal energy; and (3) multiferroics,
characterized by the ability to control electrical properties by magnetic means and vice versa.
Experiments will be done at Department of Energy user facilities to reveal the connection
between the observed properties and the short-range atomic and magnetic correlations in these
materials, with the aim of transforming our understanding of the origin of the functional
properties and guiding future materials discovery and optimization efforts. As a natural
byproduct, the research will also aid in the development of cutting-edge neutron scattering
techniques. The project features prominent involvement of undergraduate and graduate
students, who will go on to fill important needs in the national STEM workforce.

Laser Spectroscopy of Exotic Atoms and Molecules Containing Octupole-Deformed Nuclei
Dr. Ronald Fernando Garcia Ruiz, Assistant Professor
Department or Physics
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
Atomic nuclei with certain numbers of protons and neutrons can exhibit large variations
in their nuclear density distributions. The region of actinide nuclei – those having more than 88
protons (Z > 88) - is especially interesting, as it is expected to exhibit unique pear-like nuclear
shapes (octupole deformation). This exotic deformation causes a large enhancement of their
symmetry-violating nuclear properties. Measurements of these nuclear properties can provide
answers to some of the most pressing questions of modern physics, such as the origin of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry of our universe, and the properties of dark matter. Hence, these
nuclei offer distinct laboratories to investigate the emergence of nuclear phenomena, to study
the fundamental symmetries of nature, and to search for new physics beyond the Standard
Model of particle physics. Despite their importance, our experimental knowledge of these nuclei
is severely lacking. These exotic forms of matter belong to a frontier of the nuclear chart that has
been particularly challenging to produce and to study with necessary detail. This proposal aims
to perform precision laser spectroscopy measurements of atoms and molecules containing short-
lived exotic actinide nuclei, which will be uniquely produced at the new Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams (FRIB) in the US. Precision measurements of atoms containing exotic actinide nuclei will
provide their nuclear electromagnetic properties. These properties are critical to understand the
microscopic and collective structure of octupole deformed nuclei, and will establish important
benchmarks for the development of theoretical models. A complementary part of this project
will be focused on the study of molecules containing exotic isotopes of Th (Z=90) and Pa (Z=91).
These molecules are of particular interest for the study of fundamental symmetries, as their
octupole-deformed nuclei produce an enhancement of more than three orders of magnitude for
their parity- and time-reversal violating properties. This nuclear enhancement is further
amplified by the exceptionally high sensitivity of molecular systems to these effects, providing
ideal laboratories to explore the violation of fundamental symmetries.

Experimental Study of Turbulent Impurity Transport in 3D Magnetic Fields
Dr. Benedikt Geiger, Assistant Professor
Department of Engineering Physics
University of Wisconsin – Madison
Madison, WI 53715
Detailed understanding and control of impurity transport is essential for the success of
magnetic
fusion as an energy source. Impurities dilute the D-T fuel and degrade the energy confinement
of high temperature plasmas via intense line radiation, such that the accumulation of these
charged particles needs to be avoided. The impurity transport can be described by neoclassical
and turbulent contributions. While turbulent transport is mainly diffusive, neoclassical
transport
has a strong convective term. In particular, for stellarators, this is challenging as neoclassical
transport in these 3D devices is typically inwards directed. Therefore, a certain level of diffusive
transport from turbulence might be required for stable plasma operation. However, it is not
clear whether the required level of turbulence would overly degrade the energy confinement
via enhanced heat transport.
This project will investigate turbulent impurity transport on the Helically Symmetric
eXperiment (HSX) in Madison, WI and at the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator in Greifswald,
Germany. The two experiments feature different 3D magnetic field topologies and allow
transport studies from different perspectives. Existing laser ablation systems on both
experiments will be equipped with optimized and calibrated glass targets that will allow active
impurity injections with a well-controlled amount of particles. Moreover, a high-speed charge
exchange recombination spectroscopy system will be installed to monitor characteristic line
radiation emitted by the injected impurities. The spectroscopy measurements will provide
absolutely calibrated impurity densities with excellent spatial resolution and will resolve the
inwards movement of impurities toward the plasma core following the injections. Combined
with further improvements of the analysis and modelling tools, details on the diffusive and
convective impurity transport can thus be obtained. Resulting transport profiles will then be
compared with neoclassical expectations. Moreover, trends of the remaining turbulence-
induced (anomalous) transport will be compared with results from linear and non-linear
gyrokinetic simulations. In addition, the observed levels of impurity transport will be compared
with experimental heat diffusivities. This will permit the identification of conditions with good
energy confinement and a well controllable impurity behavior.

Exotic Uses of Neutrons an X-rays as Probes for Chiral Magnets
Dr. Dustin A. Gilbert, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
University of Tennessee
Knoxville, TN 37996
Computational architectures based on magnetism, termed spintronics, offer
opportunities for low-power, miniaturized, highly-portable technologies. For most magnetic
materials, the spins align parallel or antiparallel, but an alternative paradigm exists in-which the
spins form twisted, chiral structures, e.g. helices, cycloids, and skyrmions. Magnetic skyrmions
have a particularly exotic structure characterized by the spins continuously wrapping into a
closed loop. The distinction between linear and chiral magnets can be appreciated by considering
wind flowing in a continuous, linear path compared to vortex flow, like a tornado or hurricane.
Chiral magnetic structures are also of interest due to their unique fundamental qualities which
arise out of their non-trivial topology. Topology, in this context, means that chiral structures can
be continuously distorted, but an energy barrier exists to their creation or destruction which
lends stability and particle-like properties to the structure. Neutron and X-ray scattering play a
critical role in the investigation of these structures due to their ability to resolve small features
with only magnetic contrast. By leveraging recent advances in neutron and X-ray
instrumentation, and applying creative experimental and sample environment design, it is
possible to gain unparalleled insight into chiral magnets. In one research focus, measuring the
small angle scattering from chiral magnets allows the three-dimensional structure to be
determined; since the topology is defined by the geometry, it is critical to have a detailed
understanding of the structure. In another research direction, time-resolved scattering can be
used to capture the evolution of these structures in response to changing magnetic fields. In a
third focus area, inelastic scattering can be used to measure the in-situ motion and structure of
the chiral spin textures as they are dynamically excited. Understanding derived from this research
will improve the ability to manipulate and control these unique structures for low-power
spintronic technologies.

Thermodynamics and Transport Models of Strongly Coupled Dusty Plasmas
Dr. Ranganathan Gopalakrishnan, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering
The University of Memphis
Memphis, TN 38152
Complex dusty plasmas are multi-species systems that consist of electrons, ions, neutral
species, and charged micro/nanometer-sized grains interacting with each other predominantly
through electrical forces. When the number of electric charges on each dust grain reaches ~102-
104 electron charges, the electrostatic potential energy of the grains is either comparable or
much higher than their kinetic energy. In this case the dust grains become strongly coupled due
to strong electrostatic forces between them. Standard kinetic theories, used to describe dilute
gases or weakly coupled dusty plasmas, are no longer valid to describe strongly coupled dusty
plasmas because they ignore the interaction potential energy of the constituent grains. This
theoretical investigation will quantify the effect of grain-grain, grain-plasma and grain-neutral
gas interactions on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the grain phase. The central
hypothesis to this effort is that the grain positions and velocity time series measured in dusty
plasma experiments contain the information needed to calculate the evolution of the grain
position and velocity distribution functions over time, without tedious numerical methods. Using
methods of statistical mechanics, grain trajectories from a combination of experiments and
computer simulations will be used to construct accurate equilibrium (thermodynamic equations
of state) and non-equilibrium (transport coefficients) models of strongly coupled dusty plasmas.
The basic aspects of correlated grain motion of relevance to strongly coupled plasmas and dense
granular systems will be quantified as thermodynamic and transport models to fortify the
prediction capabilities of hydrodynamic/fluid simulation approaches in order to accurately
describe dust grain dynamics: (1) near the walls of thermonuclear fusion reactors where material
ablation leads to the formation of highly charged nano or microparticles, (2) in planet and
asteroid formation processes via accretion of charged grains and particles, and (3) of intentional
or unintentional gas-to-particle conversion in plasma-based semiconductor manufacturing
processes or plasma-based nanomaterial synthetic routes.

Optical Control of Spin-polarization in Quantum Materials
Dr. Marco Govoni, Assistant Scientist
Materials Science Division and Center for Molecular Engineering
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
Lemont, IL 60439
The goal of this project is to enable the development of robust solid-state qubits as
building blocks for applications in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum
computing. A central challenge encountered in the design of quantum materials is the
identification and characterization of stable point defects with robust spin properties that dictate
the light-activated quantum functionality. This limits ground-breaking discoveries with the
potential to transform computing technologies or generate a new class of nanoscale sensors with
enhanced sensitivity. One obstacle that needs to be overcome is a lack of control over the local
environment of the defect, in addition to understanding how this influences the optical cycle of
spin-polarization, and ultimately the quantum operativity. This project will develop the numerical
tools needed to understand how to obtain defects with desired functionalities by controlling their
local environments and will unravel the influence of external conditions. New computational
capabilities will be developed in order to model light-activated mechanisms in spin-defects, and
to systematically investigate the role of temperature, local structure, and quantum confinement.
This research will leverage current pre-exascale modeling capabilities based on many-body
perturbation theory and use a hierarchical modeling approach that harnesses artificial
intelligence and quantum computing. The program will deliberately utilize Argonne’s expertise
and world-class user facilities, providing insight into optical control of the spin-polarization of
color centers.

Probing the Flavor Dependence of Higgs Couplings with Charm Tagging
Dr. Heather Gray, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
The Regents of University of California
Berkeley, CA 94710
The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s
most energetic particle accelerator complex, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN) in Switzerland, was the final piece to complete the Standard Model (SM) of particle
physics, which describes all known elementary particles in the universe and their interactions.
Despite the rapid progress made in recent years to understand the characteristic properties of
the Higgs boson, many questions still remain. In particular, the direct interaction between the
Higgs boson and the quarks was first measured only two years ago at the LHC by observing the
Higgs produced in association with top quarks. The strength of the interactions or couplings
between the Higgs boson and the quarks varies between the generations, and currently only faint
experimental prospects exist to probe Higgs couplings to quarks outside of the third generation
top and bottom quarks. This research program plans to develop an innovative computational
algorithm to identify jets of particles containing second generation charm quarks at the ATLAS (A
Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment to measure SM physics processes containing charm and the
Higgs coupling to charm using data acquired from the current LHC and the future High-Luminosity
LHC runs. The charm-driven program promises to advance our knowledge of the strange quark
content of the proton, which, in turn, will impact other precision analyses at the LHC such as the
W boson mass measurement. An analysis strategy exploiting the discriminating power of the
charm-tagging algorithm is expected to result in the combination of the full suite of Higgs-charm
analyses reaching the SM sensitivity by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC era. The research can
be expected to shed new light on the SM flavor puzzle by ascertaining if the Higgs mechanism is
responsible for the masses of second generation quarks, and to determine if the Higgs-charm
coupling strength is consistent with the predictions from the Standard Model.

Deformation of Nano-Metallic Glasses Made using Colloidal Synthesis
Dr. Wendy Gu, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering
Stanford University
Stanford, CA 94305
Despite decades of intensive research, the deformation mechanisms that govern the
mechanical behavior of metallic glasses remain mysterious. This prevents the use of metallic
glasses as strong and hard structural materials and coatings. To solve this problem in metallic
glasses, it is necessary to understand the influence of their disordered atomistic structure on
strength, ductility and fracture, through controlled synthesis and high-resolution
characterization. It has been challenging to accomplish this using conventional cast or sputtered
metallic glasses because of a lack of control over metallic glass structure. In this work, colloidal
synthesis will be used to fabricate metallic glass nanoparticles with tunable atomistic structure
and composition, which can be consolidated into bulk nano-glasses. Advanced electron
microscopy, X-ray measurements and nano-mechanical testing will be used to evaluate structure
and mechanical performance. This project will 1) investigate the high ductility of colloidal metallic
glass nanoparticles, 2) evaluate the mechanical behavior of nanoparticles modified using high
pressure, and 3) determine the role of the interfaces within bulk nano-glasses. This work is
focused on fundamental understanding of deformation mechanisms and is therefore well aligned
with the BES mission.

Creating a Sea-Level-Enabled E3SM: A Critical Capability for Predicting Coastal Impacts
Dr. Matthew Hoffman, Scientist 3
Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics Group
Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos, NM 87545
Sea level change will be the most fundamental factor driving coastal change along the
U.S. – and global – coastline in the coming decades and centuries, with profound disruption and
displacement of infrastructure and communities. However, sea level does not change
uniformly, due to interactions between the ocean, ice sheets, and solid earth. Regional sea level
rise can be significantly larger or smaller (by 50% or more) than the global average, with the
U.S. coast disproportionately impacted by these variations. This project fills a critical gap in the
application of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to coastal impacts by creating a
regional sea level modeling capability within E3SM. This unique tool will be used to quantify the
role of regional sea level in future storm surge along the U.S. coast. These first fully consistent
regional sea level projections from an Earth system model will be used to investigate the
accuracy of existing methods that rely on adding disparate, non-interacting contributions to sea
level. The sea-level-enabled E3SM provides a critical missing link required for making actionable
projections of coastal impacts with E3SM. The project provides the Department of Energy with
a tool for predicting regional sea level targeted to agency needs.

Bidirectional Manipulation of Phase Transitions by Laser Excitation of Optical Phonons
Dr. Wanzheng Hu, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Boston University
Boston, MA 02215
Dynamical manipulation of quantum materials by a femtosecond laser pulse is an
emerging technique relevant to a wide range of applications including high-temperature
superconductivity, ultrafast information processing, and quantum computation. Strong-field
laser pulses tuned to specific infrared-active lattice vibrational modes can directly modify
structural parameters, which are crucial to the physical properties of quantum materials. This
research aims at bidirectional switching of ordered phases in quantum materials using laser
excitation of optical phonons. The focus will be on laser manipulation to change the phase in
either direction. The goal is to steer materials towards desirable states on demand, which will
advance the understanding of phase transitions and competing interactions in quantum
materials. The main objectives include: (1) Dynamical bidirectional tuning of nematicity in
complex oxides and high-temperature superconductors and (2) Ultrafast bidirectional switching
of ferroelectric polarization in ferroelectrics. If successful, the ultrafast light source developed in
this project can be adapted to femtosecond x-rays or ultrafast electron diffraction, to investigate
intertwined orders in quantum materials. It can also be integrated with time-resolved scanning
probe microscopies for ultrafast imaging of spatial inhomogeneity in quantum materials, which
is the basis of various novel electronic and magnetic properties.

Idaho National Laboratory
Idaho Falls, ID 83402
Computational modeling and simulation play a critical role in the development and
deployment of any complex engineering system—fusion energy is no exception. The Fusion
Energy Sciences (FES) program supports research such as “Whole Device Modeling,” which seeks
to assemble numerous physics models to create an integrated simulation of the plasma. One of
the grand engineering challenges on the path to fusion energy is the successful production and
recovery of tritium in a breeding blanket. This work seeks to extend the domain of “Whole Device
Modeling” by leveraging high-performance computing capabilities and the Multiphysics Object-
Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) to develop fundamentally informed simulation tools
for the complex multiphysics environment of the blanket. The focus is on tritium transport in
two blanket concepts identified as potentially transformative enabling capabilities for fusion
energy: The Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) and Cellular Ceramic Breeder. Hierarchical multi-
scale modeling of the DCLL and the Cellular Ceramic Breeder will explore the influence of high
magnetic fields and material structure on tritium transport. The MOOSE framework will
facilitate coupling to other (e.g. neutronic) physics models and plant-scale thermal hydraulic and
tritium transport simulation tools. The suite of tools developed will critically inform blanket
concept down-selection, component design, and safety evaluations necessary for the realization
of fusion energy.

Next-Generation Beam Cooling and Control with Optical Stochastic Cooling
Dr. Jonathan Jarvis, Associate Scientist
Accelerator Research Department: Accelerator Division
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
The ability to non-invasively detect the state and dynamics of charged particles and then
actively manipulate those particles with feedback systems is a core conceptual and technological
element underlying most accelerator-based science. This fundamental area advances through
improvements in the granularity and rapidity with which beams can be sensed and manipulated,
and one of the next frontiers is the use of each particle’s incoherent optical synchrotron radiation
(SR) to control its dynamics in a coherent fashion. The central purpose of this program is a
multiple order-of-magnitude advance in the state of the art for particle-beam cooling and
control. This will be accomplished at Fermilab’s Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) through
the development and demonstration of an operational optical stochastic cooling (OSC) system
with >1000x optical-power gain and an additional 60x increase in the density of transverse
sensing and feedback. The flexibility and performance of this system will be used in concert with
machine-learning techniques, such as online reinforcement learning, to modulate the OSC force
and realize a new state of the art in active phase-space control. This program will also explore
the development of specialized diffractive optics for OSC, which may open the way to
fundamentally new capabilities and opportunities based on OSC physics and technology. Lastly,
the results of this research will be applied to the design and optimization of operational
architectures for near-term applications in beam cooling, radiation generation and phase-space
sensing. Such applications include high-bandwidth cooling of high-energy hadron beams (~0.25
TeV to 6 TeV), electron-ring coolers for medium-energy hadrons, enhanced SR-damping systems
for electron storage rings, platforms for quantum-science experiments using one or more
relativistic electrons, and the development of novel beam-imaging diagnostics and advanced
phase-space-control systems.

Realization of Full Neutron Polarization Control:
Next Generation Spherical Neutron Polarimetry for Neutron Scattering
Dr. Chenyang “Peter” Jiang, Staff Scientist
Neutron Technologies Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
Quantum materials play a significant role in today’s science and have the potential to
revolutionize energy-related technologies and other fields. In particular, understanding
magnetism lies at the forefront of basic research of many technologically relevant quantum
materials. Advances in quantum spin liquids, skyrmion lattices, spin-orbit and spin-lattice
couplings, and superconductivity all require a deeper understanding of magnetism in quantum
materials. The fact that the neutron has no net charge and possesses a magnetic moment makes
neutron scattering an ideal tool for studying magnetism. Moreover, like using a small probe
magnet to measure magnetic field distribution, the ability to polarize neutrons makes neutron
scattering even more sensitive to magnetism in materials. The goal of this project is to enable
neutron scattering studies of complex noncollinear magnetic structures and investigations of
hybrid correlation functions coupling different degrees of freedom (spin-lattice, spin-orbit, spin-
chirality) using full polarization analysis. This will be accomplished by developing next-generation
Spherical Neutron Polarimetry (SNP) capabilities to be deployed across multiple neutron
instruments at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The new SNP capability will deliver the most advanced
tool in the world for the study of magnetism using neutrons and help resolve questions that are
otherwise intractable or cannot be unambiguously determined using traditional methods. The
technical development will place ORNL at the forefront of polarized neutron scattering
capabilities world-wide, and its implementation will be game-changing across a range of science
themes and will also lay the groundwork for its future application on instruments at the Second
Target Station (STS).

Lattice Calculation of the QED Corrections to Meson Leptonic Decay
Dr. Luchang Jin, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Connecticut
Storrs, CT 06259
The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, as the basic parameters in
particle physics, describe how quark decays into other types of quark. Its precise measurement
provides a rigorous test for particle physics' standard model. Determining the light quark-related
CKM matrix element requires both experimental measurement and theoretical calculations of
the corresponding hadron decay process. At present, accuracy is limited by theoretical
calculations. In this research, high-precision lattice field theory calculations will be performed for
the K meson (semi-)leptonic decay process to improve the accuracy of the corresponding CKM
matrix element. The calculation will pay special attention to the effects of electromagnetic
interaction, which is necessary to achieve the required accuracy. This research will mainly use
two techniques to include electromagnetic effects. The first is to make full use of the parsed
photon propagators in lattice calculations to improve accuracy. This method is very effective in
the lattice field theory calculation of the contribution to the strong interaction of the muon
magnetic moment. The second is to use the recently developed infinite volume reconstruction
method. This method will effectively deal with the finite volume error and infrared divergence
caused by the long-range electromagnetic interaction. The lattice field theory calculations
performed in this study will also improve the determination of the light quark mass, determine
the electromagnetic correction of the neutron decay, and provide theoretical limitations for the
cross-section of neutrino nucleon scattering.

High Brightness Photocathodes in Photoinjectors
Dr. Siddharth Karkare, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ 85287
The performance of existing and future ultrafast science instruments like X-ray Free
Electron Lasers (XFELs), Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED), and Ultrafast Electron Microscopy
(UEM) is limited by the brightness of electron beams produced from photocathodes in
photoinjectors. Generation of brighter electron beams from photoinjectors requires the
development of photocathodes capable of emitting electrons with the smallest possible mean
transverse energy (MTE), or equivalently, the smallest possible intrinsic emittance. With the goal
of improving the performance of the above applications, over the last decade, a significant effort
has gone into understanding the process of photoemission and reducing the MTE of electrons
emitted from cathodes. As a result, several ways of achieving low MTEs of 20-30 meV have been
developed and MTE as low as 5 meV has been demonstrated. Despite these large improvements
in MTE, photoinjectors still use cathodes with a large (~500 meV) MTE.
This research aims to identify and resolve the issues involved in using these low-MTE
cathodes in photoinjectors and develop cathodes for low-MTE (sub-25 meV) operation in new
photoinjectors, resulting in nearly 25 times brighter electron beams. The ultimate goal of the
research is to demonstrate low-MTE (and thus high-brightness) operation in the existing and new
photoinjectors being developed to power future XFEL and UED/UEM facilities. The proposed
increase in brightness will result in a dramatically increased X-ray pulse energy in existing XFELs
maximizing their potential to study atomic and electronic structural dynamics in quantum
materials, electronic and nuclear coupling in biological and chemical processes and energy
materials in situ. It is also critical for the development of compact XFELs to make them widely
accessible. For UED/UEM applications, the proposed increase in beam brightness implies an
increase in the spatio-temporal resolution greatly increasing the scientific reach of these ultrafast
electron scattering techniques. Thus, this work will transform the capabilities of various existing
and upcoming DOE facilities, opening new frontiers in ultrafast studies of quantum materials,
energy technologies, and critical biological processes.

Extreme Drought, Heat and Wildfire Impacts on Future Coastal Water Relations
Dr. Trevor F. Keenan, Assistant Professor
Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management
UC Berkeley
Berkeley, CA 94720
Ecosystem water use plays a large role in determining surface water availability, and
thus streamflow, and societies water resources. Water use and streamflow are highly sensitive
to multiple climate extremes, many of which are co-occurring and compounding events. It is the
co-occurrence of extremes that poses the biggest risk to ecosystems and society, as co-
occurring climate extremes amplify impacts due to multiple nonlinear interactions. Coastal
regions of the western US exhibit strong spatial gradients in water resources and provide an
excellent testbed to understand the influence of compound and sequential extreme events on
ecosystem water use and the resulting effects on streamflow and water relations. In tandem,
dense observation networks such as AmeriFlux and the USGS stream gage network provide an
opportunity to examine the impact of extremes on coastal water resources, as we move to no-
analogue environments in the coastal regions of the future. This project will examine the
impact of extreme drought, heat and wildfire on water relations of the coastal western US,
integrating machine learning, Earth System Models, and emulators with distributed sensor
networks to do so. The strategic combination of novel observationally-informed techniques
within a model benchmarking framework, combining both the water and carbon cycles along
with associated uncertainties, will greatly improve our understanding of the relationship
between coastal ecosystem function and current and future water resources.

The Non-Equilibrium Quantum Frontier
Dr. Vedika Khemani, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Stanford University
Stanford, CA 94305
A central goal of condensed matter physics is to study universal emergent properties –
those that characterize the collectivity but not the individual constituents – of macroscopic
quantum systems with large numbers of interacting particles. In the traditional approach, a major
conceptual simplification is afforded by studying many-body systems close to (thermal)
equilibrium at long distances and low temperatures – a wildly successful enterprise that has led
to the discovery of many novel phases of matter ranging from exotic superconductors to
topological insulators. More recently, a confluence of theoretical and experimental advances
across a range of subfields in physics has opened up a vast new territory of studying many-body
phenomena in completely novel regimes: highly excited, quantum coherent, and far from
equilibrium. In these settings, most well-established methods in quantum many body theory do
not apply. Our understanding of even fundamental questions of quantum statistical mechanics,
such as whether or how isolated quantum systems can bring themselves to thermal equilibrium
under their own dynamics - or fail to do so - is still nascent. From the perspective of condensed
matter physics, an exciting new opportunity entails understanding the new kinds of emergent
universal many-body phenomena that can arise once the strictures of equilibrium
thermodynamics are relaxed. A paradigmatic example is the recent discovery of time-crystals – a
phase of matter disallowed in thermal equilibrium – in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting
of a periodically driven, many-body localized system.
This research spans three broad research thrusts: (i) formulating and understanding the
full range of `dynamical universality classes', and the novel phase transitions between these; (ii)
exploring new kinds of phenomena that may be realized out-of-equilibrium; and (iii) formulating
new information theoretic approaches for studying many-body quantum dynamics. In all, this
wide-ranging research plan aims to push the exciting and interdisciplinary non-equilibrium

Illuminating the Molecular Pathways of Trace Element Incorporation During Crystal Growth
Dr. Laura Lammers, Research Scientist
Energy Geosciences Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
Natural aqueous fluids contain complex mixtures of dissolved constituents, so mineral
growth in the environment leads to incorporation of impurities. These impurities impact the
structure and stability of the precipitated minerals. Understanding impurity uptake is
complicated by the fact that crystals can form by classical addition of individual ions such as Ca2+
or CO 2-, or by more complex, non-classical processes involving pairs or larger clusters of ions up
3
to small nanometer-sized precursor crystallites. Our lack of understanding of how the different
growth processes affect the uptake of trace elements undermines our ability to capture rare or
energy-important elements from geologic or anthropogenic water sources and also to interpret
Earth history through diagnostic trace element signatures present in the minerals in rock
formations that record this history. This project aims to identify the molecular pathways of trace
element incorporation for two important classes of minerals, carbonates and phosphates, which
are known to form by classical and non-classical pathways. The core hypothesis informing this
work is that the relative rates of monomer dehydration and growth unit attachment regulate the
preferred incorporation pathway for a given species regardless of the product phase. A
multimodal study is proposed to identify dominant molecular building blocks using time-resolved
X-Ray scattering and spectroscopy and to trace the evolution of growth unit structure and
composition during trace element incorporation using atomic-resolution imaging coupled with
molecular simulations of the different types of growth processes. This work will inform the
development of kinetic models that predict impurity uptake in multicomponent aqueous
solutions with broad applicability to ionic crystals. These discoveries will impact the design of
novel crystallization technologies to isolate valuable elements from complex feedstocks and to
immobilize and secure toxic and radioactive species

The BeEST: A Search for keV-Scale Sterile Neutrinos using Superconducting Quantum Sensors
Dr. Kyle G. Leach, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Colorado School of Mines
Golden, CO 80401
The search for sterile neutrinos is perhaps the brightest possibilities in our quest for
understanding the microscopic nature of the observed dark matter (DM) in our Universe. Sterile
neutrinos – unlike the active neutrinos in the Standard Model – do not interact with normal
matter as they move through space, and are thus best observed using their mass signature. In
this work, complete momentum reconstruction of electron-capture (EC) nuclear decay is
employed to perform a search for sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range that is 10,000 times
more sensitive than previous experiments. This is achieved using the EC decay of radioactive
beryllium-7 atoms implanted into sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs) - an
experiment nicknamed the BeEST ("beast") for Beryllium Electron capture in STjs. A discovery
signature in the BeEST experiment would be a small fraction of these decays where the daughter
(lithium-7) atomic recoil peaks are shifted to lower energies from momentum conservation with
these new, heavy sterile neutrinos. This approach is a uniquely powerful experimental method
since it relies only on the well-motivated existence of this new type of neutrino, and not on how
they might hypothetically interact with normal matter.

HydroX: Using Hydrogen Doped in Liquid Xenon to Search for Dark Matter
Dr. Hugh Lippincott, Assistant Professor
Physics Department
Regents of the University of California
Santa Barbara, CA 93106
The nature of dark matter is one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. Experimental
efforts searching for dark matter particles over the last few decades have ruled out many
candidates, and the new generation of tonne-scale liquid xenon detectors like the LUX-Zeplin (LZ)
experiment will cover two more orders of magnitude in sensitivity. Recent theoretical work
suggests that dark matter might be lighter than the optimal search range of experiments like LZ,
and this research aims to enable LZ to search for an order of magnitude lighter dark matter
masses by adding hydrogen to the liquid xenon, in an upgrade called HydroX. Being the lightest
element, hydrogen is a much better target than xenon for searching for light dark matter because
it is easier to transfer momentum between objects of similar mass, much like a ping pong ball
cannot impart energy to a bowling ball. Considerations of the nature of signal generation in liquid
xenon argue that the signal produced by a dark matter-hydrogen interaction will be significantly
larger as well, further increasing the sensitivity to the lightest particles. By putting hydrogen into
the existing LZ detector, this research capitalizes on the significant investment already made in
LZ construction, taking advantage of the most radioactively quiet place on earth. The first priority
of this research is to measure the response of liquid xenon to hydrogen and determine the
ultimate sensitivity of HydroX. The work will observe how much hydrogen can be readily
dissolved in liquid xenon, and then expose that mixture to very low energy neutron sources to
mimic dark matter particles. The second part of the research will focus on the thermodynamics
of hydrogen-doped liquid xenon. In LZ, 10 tonnes of liquid xenon are circulated through a purifier
every 2.5 days, and major effort is needed to understand how to introduce hydrogen on that
scale without upsetting the balance required to keep the liquid xenon cold. The final result of
HydroX will be a fully characterized upgrade to LZ that will increase the sensitivity by more than
an order of magnitude towards lower dark matter masses and hopefully to understand the
mysterious nature of dark matter.

A Unified Picture of Long- and Short-range Dynamics of Atomic Nuclei
Dr. Alessandro Lovato, Assistant Physicist
Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Atomic nuclei are self-bound systems of fermions that display emergent quantum-
mechanical phenomena. Testing their structure and reactions at low energies is the primary focus
of domestic experimental facilities, including the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System, the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.
Experiments at Thomas Jefferson Laboratory and the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider probe the
internal structure of the nucleus and the interplay between nucleonic and partonic degrees of
freedom by examining short-distance phenomena. The main objective of this research is to
connect the physics scope of the domestic nuclear experimental program. It provides a unified
theoretical picture of the long-range structure and short-range dynamics of atomic nuclei starting
from the individual interactions among their constituents: neutrons and protons. The research
project enables breakthrough developments of the nuclear Green’s Monte Carlo methods,
currently limited to nuclei with up to A=12 nucleons. This project capitalizes on high-performance
computing resources, including the forthcoming exascale machines, and entails the development
of novel representations of the nuclear wave functions in terms of artificial neural networks.
Besides covering many areas in nuclear physics, this research has critical applications in high-
energy physics, specifically on the neutrino-oscillation programs. It also impacts multi-messenger
astrophysics, as high-density nuclear dynamics is imprinted in the gravitational-waves and
neutrino-emission signals of merging neutron stars.

Electrocatalytic Alkene Epoxidation at Disrupted Metal Ensembles in Blended Electrolytes
Dr. Manthiram, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical Engineering
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
Future routes for modular, point-of-need chemical manufacturing may utilize distributed
renewable feedstocks, such as water, carbon dioxide, and dinitrogen, as well as distributed
energy sources, such as solar and wind electricity. Among the many possible chemical targets for
this sustainable chemical manufacturing paradigm, epoxides are attractive due to their significant
energy and carbon footprint during production and status as nexus molecules in the chemical
industry, where they provide access to diverse, high-volume plastics, textiles, and adhesives. The
current thermochemical and wet chemical synthesis routes for epoxides partially oxidize an
alkene with an oxygen-atom source to produce an epoxide. Thermochemical routes for
epoxidation suffer from significant carbon dioxide emissions, while the wet chemical routes lead
to stoichiometric waste products and significant hazards in handling reagents. These
shortcomings motivate the development of a sustainable method for epoxidation, in which water
can be used as an oxygen-atom source. The objective of this research is to develop
electrocatalysts which facilitate the efficient anodic conversion of water and alkenes into
epoxides, while generating hydrogen at the cathode. The research will elucidate the molecular-
level steps through which water is oxidized and how an oxygen-atom is ultimately transferred to
an alkene. The role of disrupted metal ensembles and blended electrolytes in controlling rates of
epoxidation will be understood. The work will broadly lead to advances in controlling catalytic
surfaces and the surrounding electrolyte environment to direct the electrosynthesis of organic
molecules of large energy footprint.

Investigation of Helicon and Lower Hybrid Wave Coupling with the Edge Plasma for Current
Drive Optimization in the Tokamak Using Laser Spectroscopy
Dr. Elijah H. Martin, Associate Staff Scientist
Fusion Energy Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
Magnetic confinement fusion would provide an abundant source of clean energy and help
reduce the threats of climate change. The limiting factors to deploying fusion energy are
continuous, reliable power production and the high costs associated with building and operating
reactors. To address these issues, the Helicon and High-Field Side Lower Hybrid (HFS-LH)
programs were established at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility. These programs are
investigating innovative and efficient methods to generate plasma current using radio frequency
(RF) waves, which is critical because tokamak fusion reactors require a constant plasma current
for continuous power production. This research will combine novel laser-based spectroscopy and
advanced quantum mechanical modeling to experimentally measure the RF wave’s electric field
vector. Leveraging world-leading exascale high-performance computing capabilities, these
measurements will be compared to 3D full-wave simulations to understand the RF waves
interaction with the edge plasma. The work will provide groundbreaking insight to accelerate
progress in generating efficient plasma current using RF waves.

Converting Metal–Organic Liquids into Microporous Glasses via Non-Equilibrium Syntheses
Dr. Jarad A. Mason, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology
Harvard University
Cambridge, MA 02143
Glasses are critical to many of the technologies that support our modern lifestyle, and
new types of glassy materials are likely to play an important role in addressing a wide range of
global challenges. Despite their tremendous importance, the compositional and structural
diversity of glasses that have been designed, synthesized, and studied to date pales in
comparison to other classes of materials. The realization of new types of glasses is complicated
by the intrinsic non-equilibrium nature of all glass phases, which are—with few exceptions—
metastable compared to an equilibrium crystalline phase at a given temperature and pressure.
This research will apply coordination chemistry principles and non-equilibrium synthesis
techniques to the design of novel glasses. Through a comprehensive study of the factors that
govern the conversion of a metal–organic liquid to a metastable glass, we will establish design
principles for the non-equilibrium synthesis of glasses featuring new behaviors and previously
inaccessible functionalities that are both technologically relevant and fundamentally insightful.
Specifically, the design, synthesis, and characterization of metal–organic glasses will lead to novel
glass compositions and structures that offer access to properties, such as tunable microporosity,
not found in conventional chalcogenide, metallic, organic polymer, or inorganic oxide glasses.
The fundamental structure-property relationships established in this project will inform efforts
to design new materials for a wide range of applications relevant to energy technologies,
including phase-change memory, membranes, coatings, optical materials, structural materials,
solid electrolytes, and radioactive waste storage. Moreover, metal–organic glasses will provide a
powerful platform to explore fundamental aspects of the glass transition and, more broadly, of
the basic science underpinning the synthesis of metastable materials under conditions far from
equilibrium.

New Molecular Mechanisms for Greenhouse Gas Capture in Metal–Organic Frameworks:
Carbon Dioxide and Beyond
Dr. Phillip Milner, Assistant Professor

Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14850
This research aims to advance the field of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in order to
enable the selective capture of greenhouse gases at industrial point sources and their subsequent
utilization to prepare value-added products. While carbon dioxide is a targeted molecule to
capture and convert, there are other inescapable greenhouse gases with untapped potential
value beyond carbon dioxide, including nitrous oxide (N O) and hydrofluorocarbons. The work
2
focuses upon the unique reactivities of each gas – specifically, the electrophilicity of carbon
dioxide, the oxidizing nature of nitrous oxide, and the halogen-bonding affinity of
hydrofluorocarbons – to explore new molecular-level mechanisms for their selective binding
within porous materials. Doing so will provide insights for new strategies to reduce
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions while unlocking new routes for their application in
sustainable synthesis.

Constraining the Electromagnetic Shower Energy Scale at LArTPC Neutrino Detectors Near
and Far
Dr. Michael Mooney, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Colorado State University
Fort Collins, CO 80523
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Facility is an international project that will be the largest particle physics experiment ever built in
North America. The DUNE project will use massive liquid argon time projection chambers
(LArTPCs) to address fundamental questions such as the origin of the matter/antimatter
asymmetry in the universe. In order to answer such questions, DUNE will make measurements
that probe the nature of neutrino oscillation, the changing of neutrino flavor (electron, muon, or
tau) during the flight from source to detector, with unprecedented precision. Another upcoming
neutrino oscillation experiment is the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program, which will use
multiple LArTPC detectors to investigate the anomalous phenomenon of neutrino oscillation over
shorter distances that could lead to the discovery of “sterile” neutrinos. Both DUNE and the SBN
Program rely on precise measurements of electron neutrino interactions, which produce
electromagnetic showers in LArTPC detectors. The energies of these electromagnetic showers
must be well understood to achieve the main physics goals of each experiment. The primary
objective of this research is to constrain the electromagnetic shower energy scale at DUNE and
the SBN Program through precise calibration of detector effects and use of neutral pion decays
to photons, which also produce electromagnetic showers in LArTPC detectors. This research
includes development of the DUNE LArTPC near detector to obtain the full potential in this energy
scale constraint.

Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ 85287
Catalysts provide low-energy pathways for driving chemical transformations and are
utilized in applications ranging from manufacturing fuels and fine-chemicals to controlling the
bioenergetics essential to all living organisms. Although the ability to catalyze fuel-forming
reactions using sunlight as an energy source has been demonstrated, finding ways to more
effectively interface catalysts with light-absorbing materials remains challenging as there is not
enough understanding of how charge carriers move through these systems. The objectives of this
research include: (1) synthesizing catalysts with tailored electronic states that promote both
electron-transfer and proton-transfer processes, (2) developing methods to interface these
catalysts with light-absorbing semiconductors, and (3) enhancing fundamental understandings
of the interplay between light absorption, charge transfer, and catalysis. While structurally more
complex than their isolated components, the hierarchical materials used in this research move
beyond traditional model systems and toward studying the basic energy science of using solar
photochemistry to produce fuels and other industrially relevant chemicals.

DataStates: Scalable Versioning for Scientific Data
Dr. Bogdan Nicolae, Computer Scientist
Mathematics and Computer Science
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
The advent of big data analytics and artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the data
requirements of modern high performance computing (HPC) applications. A fundamental
challenge is the inability to capture, search and reuse data as they are calculated, which would
allow researchers to revisit previous states to explore alternatives; improve the coupling of
workflow components; and understand and explain the evolution of data. Current state of the
art data services manipulate datasets as files and key-value pairs, making it impossible to address
this challenge in an efficient and scalable way. This proposal advocates a different data model
based on a new concept of Data States. In this model, users do not interact with a data service
directly to read/write datasets but rather tag datasets with properties expressing hints,
constraints, and persistency semantics, which automatically adds snapshots of these datasets
(called data states) into the lineage-- a history recording all intermediate data states based on an
optimal action plan that automatically performs any needed read/write actions. The lineage of
data states has several advantages. First, it allows application developers to focus on the meaning
and properties of their data, rather than on the manipulations needed to read/write, restructure,
and reorder data. Second, it brings an incentive to collaborate more, verify and understand the
results more thoroughly by sharing and analyzing intermediate results. Third, it encourages the
development of new algorithms and ideas that reuse and revisit intermediate and historical data
frequently. Such capabilities are particularly important to facilitate quicker advances at the
intersection of HPC, artificial intelligence and big data analytics.

Crosstalk: Interkingdom Interactions in the Mycorrhizal Hyphosphere and Ramifications for
Soil C Cycling
Dr. Erin E Nuccio, Staff Scientist
Physical and Life Sciences Directorate
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ancient symbionts that form root associations
with 80% of the world’s plants. AMF play an important role in global nutrient and carbon cycles,
and understanding their biology is crucial to predict how carbon is stored and released from soil.
The region of soil surrounding the fungal body (or hyphae) is called the hyphosphere, which is
the zone where much of this nutrient and carbon cycling occurs. However, the hyphosphere is
one of the least understood components of the plant-mycorrhizal-soil system. It is hypothesized
that AMF rely on microbes living in the hyphosphere to access key nutrients from soil organic
matter. In fact, synergistic interactions between AMF and soil microbes have been estimated to
contribute 70,000 tons of assimilated plant nitrogen annually. This research will investigate the
basic mechanisms that underpin these interactions and drive nitrogen and carbon cycling in the
hyphosphere, addressing DOE’s mission to understand and predict the roles of microbes in
Earth’s nutrient cycles. By coupling isotope-enabled technologies with next generation DNA
sequencing techniques, this project will investigate soil microbial communities in their
notoriously heterogeneous natural environment. This work will provide a greater mechanistic
understanding needed to determine how mycorrhizal fungi influence organic matter
decomposition and will shed light on large-scale nutrient cycling processes in terrestrial
ecosystems.

Improving Accelerators with Diagnostics Optimized for Artificial Intelligence
Dr. Brendan O'Shea, Staff Scientist
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, CA 94025
Beams of accelerated particles drive scientific research and discovery in fields ranging
from fundamental physics to biology, including the discovery of why particles have mass and the
study of proteins on the surface of viruses. The primary goal of this research is to develop a
paradigm for producing ultra-short particle beams that are at least an order of magnitude higher
in quality than presently possible. Higher quality beams would reduce the amount of
experimental time needed to make discoveries at a linear collider or X-ray free-electron laser
(XFEL), and at the same time broaden access to facilities that are in high demand. Two of the
main challenges associated with generating these beams – measuring the beam characteristics
and controlling the accelerator to the level required to preserve their quality – will require
specialized non-invasive, real-time diagnostics that use artificial intelligence for beam
measurement and control. This research will develop and deploy single-shot, non-invasive
emittance and energy spread diagnostics based on edge radiation at the FACET-II accelerator at
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Once deployed, these novel diagnostics will use artificial
intelligence to monitor and control the evolution of the particle beam throughout the accelerator
in real time. The success of this research will directly benefit the operation of existing facilities,
such as LCLS, as well as concepts for future accelerators.

Variability and Change in Tropical Cyclone Characteristics: Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean
Drivers and Coastal Impacts
Dr. Christina M. Patricola, Assistant Professor
Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences
Iowa State University
Ames, IA 50011
Tropical cyclones (TCs) are the leading cause of weather-related economic loss in the U.S.,
accounting for $938.2 billion over 1980-2019. Into the future, coastal regions are expected to
face compounding challenges from TCs and sea-level rise. Despite the societal and economic risk
TCs pose, grand challenges remain including a lack of consensus on future change in global TC
number and uncertainty in the magnitude of regional change in TC intensity and precipitation.
This knowledge gap stems from the lack of a theory to explain what constrains annual TC number,
and a limited understanding of how various coupled atmosphere-ocean processes alter TC
intensity in different climate states. The urgency of addressing the challenge to make reliable
future TC projections is escalating with increasing coastal development and population growth,
the high economic output of U.S. coastal regions, the vulnerability of infrastructure to coastal
flooding, and sea-level rise. This research will (1) quantify how local-scale processes and
atmosphere-ocean interactions shape TC intensity in a changing climate (e.g., TC intensity and
associated wind-driven ocean mixing, TC precipitation and associated freshwater flux to the
ocean, and upper-ocean thermal and salinity conditions); (2) determine the primary large-scale
physical drivers that control the spatial and temporal statistics of landfalling TCs (e.g., inter-basin
and intra-basin ocean temperature gradients, greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings, TC steering
flow, and TC precursors); and (3) translate the knowledge developed in 1 and 2, together with
sea-level rise projections, into coastal impacts due to the combination of storm surge, heavy
precipitation, and strong winds associated with TCs. We will address these problems using
observations and climate models including the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM),
a convection-permitting atmosphere-ocean regional climate model, and a storm surge model.
This research will advance the resilience of North American coastal systems to climate change by
determining how local coupled processes and large-scale drivers control historical and future TC
characteristics.

Understanding the Dynamics of Single-Site Heterogeneous Catalysts
Dr. Frédéric A. Perras, Associate Scientist
Chemical and Biological Sciences
Ames Laboratory
Ames, IA 50011
Dynamic motions of molecules play a central role in many, if not most, catalytic processes
but the impacts they have on catalytic efficiency and selectivity remain largely unknown. This is
primarily due to the lack of techniques for examining the structure of moving analytes with
atomic-scale resolution. Of particular interest are the dynamics that occur at equilibrium, such
as the conformational rearrangements required to stabilize, and favor, a given transition state.
These molecular motions are, unfortunately, particularly difficult to observe, as they do not lead
to bulk structural changes and operate largely at the molecular level. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is unique among characterization tools in that it is sensitive to
dynamics over a time scale spanning at least ten orders of magnitude and can also resolve
molecular structures with sub-Å precision. Because of these characteristics, NMR spectroscopy
became the primary tool used to understand the dynamics of enzymes and other
macromolecules. Until recently, however, the adaptation of these techniques to the study of
heterogeneous catalysts has been limited by NMR’s inherently low sensitivity, which is
compounded by the severe dilution of active sites. Recently, with the development of ultra-fast
magic-angle-spinning and dynamic nuclear polarization, it has become possible to extend the
reach of NMR spectroscopy and yield the first three-dimensional structures of single-site
heterogeneous catalysts. The objectives of this research program are to build on these pioneering
developments to not only reveal the precise structures of catalytic sites but also evaluate how
these three-dimensional structures evolve in time. The research will uncover novel dynamic
structure-activity relationships that could in turn be used to rationally tune the selectivity, or
activity, of a catalyst.

Topology-Preserving Data Sketching for Scientific Visualization
Dr. Bei Wang Phillips, Assistant Professor
School of Computing, Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute
University of Utah
Salt Lake City, UT 84112
We are experiencing an information overload from streams of data that arise from
scientific instruments and simulations. For example, material scientists use molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations to study how fluids (such as gas, oil, and water) interact with heterogeneous
porous solids (such as ceramics, cement, and rock) to improve transport phenomena within
porous materials, which play critical roles in our energy sector. Such simulations generate large,
time-varying, and complex forms of data under different physical and chemical conditions.
Keeping track of interesting phenomena and applying appropriate actions (such as storage,
analysis, and visualization) while the simulation is running is necessary but challenging. To
address this challenge, the goal is no longer to capture and store observations or simulation in
detail, but rather to process data efficiently and approximately in order to create a summary -- a
sketch -- which allows queries over large volumes of data to be answered quickly.
The objective of this research is to conduct a systematic study of topology-preserving data
sketching techniques to improve visual exploration and understanding of large scientific data.
The project will employ topological sketches, that is, compressed representations of the full data
that preserve their important structural properties, to support analysis and visualization as the
data are generated. Our proposed solution transforms data sketching ideas from statistics,
geometry, and linear algebra to develop new topological sketches of complex data. Such sketches
will exploit the high spatial resolution and temporal fidelity of in situ data in an intelligent and
scalable way. They will reduce data in situ while preserving its structural properties, and
subsequently support interactive data exploration. In addition, topological triggers will be
integrated into an adaptive workflow to support anomaly detection, computational steering, and
decision optimization. The multidisciplinary nature of the proposed work will be broadly
applicable in many scientific areas, including applications in computational fluid dynamics and
materials science.

Deciphering Spin and Orbital Dynamics in Quantum Materials through Neutron Scattering
Dr. Kemp Plumb, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Brown University
Providence, RI 02912
Magnetism arises from the collective organization of a material’s constituent electrons
into a regular pattern. In some cases, quantum mechanics overcomes the tendency towards
order and leads to phases of matter where the many magnetic degrees of freedom are entangled.
Such states of quantum matter offer new windows into fundamental physics and may form the
basis for future quantum information technologies. Typically, these phases emerge in materials
with competing electronic energy scales, but they are notoriously difficult to predict. Tantamount
to this theoretical challenge is the experimental task of identifying such quantum states of
matter. This project coordinates a materials synthesis effort with state-of-the-art neutron
scattering techniques to elucidate the hierarchy of collective excitations in magnetic quantum
materials. The goal is to obtain a quantitative understanding of the interplay between spin,
orbital, and lattice energy scales in materials where spin-orbit coupling and electronic
correlations conspire to determine the ground state. The results of this research will provide
essential input to establish theoretical frameworks for predicting the properties of quantum
magnets with fluctuating spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In turn, this knowledge will guide
the design of materials and devices with novel quantum functionalities.

Exascale Simulations of Neutron Star Mergers
Dr. David Radice, Assistant Professor
Departments of Physics and Astronomy & Astrophysics
The Pennsylvania State University
University Park, PA 16802
Gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from colliding neutron stars (NSs)
encode precious information about the internal structure and composition of NSs and reveal the
explosions in which some of the most heavy elements, such as gold, platinum, and uranium are
formed. Relativistic heavy-ion collisions and experiments such as PREX here on Earth are probing
the nature of matter under extreme conditions. The nuclear physics involved in the creation of
the heavy elements will be more tightly constrained as FRIB comes online in the next years.
However, as observations and laboratory measurements improve, so must the theoretical
understanding of NS mergers in order to maximize the science return from these large scale
investments. Ab-initio supercomputer simulations are the only tool able to bridge astronomical
observations and laboratory experiments and connect them to the merger dynamics. However,
current simulation results are affected by large systematic errors stemming from the inability to
resolve all spatial and temporal scales in mergers and by their approximate treatments of
neutrinos. This project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a new simulation
infrastructure able to leverage next-generation supercomputer hardware, enabling calculations
at unprecedented resolutions and extending over long timescales. One of the key deliverables is
a new neutrino transport solver including general-relativistic and quantum kinetic effects using
the filtered spherical harmonics and Galerkin methods, some of the most sophisticated
approaches developed in the applied mathematics and computational physics communities. This
project develops the theory foundations needed to address some of the most pressing questions
in nuclear astrophysics such as the nature of matter inside NSs and the astrophysical site of
production of the heavy elements.

Characterizing Virus-driven Alterations of Microbial Metabolism in Model Soil Ecosystems
Dr. Simon Roux, Research Scientist

Berkeley, CA 94720
Soil microbes are globally important as they shape major nutrient cycles, drive energy
conversion processes, and strongly impact terrestrial ecosystems that are relevant for DOE’s
mission in energy and the environment. In aquatic ecosystems, viruses are important regulators
of microbial physiology. In soils, even though a large diversity of viruses has been discovered,
their role and impact on microbial activity remains poorly understood. This research will use a
combination of experimental approaches and large-scale data analysis to better characterize how
viruses infect soil microbes and affect ecosystem function. The project will characterize the
networks connecting soil viruses to their microbial hosts and their associated metabolisms in a
comprehensive way. A comparison of arid and humid ecosystems over time will uncover how
virus/host interactions are transformed by environmental conditions. The mechanisms by which
soil viruses control their host cells and alter their metabolism will be studied in further detail
using simplified soil communities in culture, as well as microfluidic devices. Such high-resolution
measurements will enable the integration of viral biology into predictive models covering
multiple scales, from the single-cell to the ecosystem level.

Current photovoltaic materials do not convert the full potential energy of sunlight to
electricity or fuels. The fundamental problem is that all excess solar photon energy above the
semiconductor band gap is lost as heat in a process called hot-carrier thermalization. Avoiding
thermalization energy losses is of paramount significance because hot-carrier-based systems
theoretically achieve 66% efficiency, which breaks the conventional limit of 33%. This research
project will advance fundamental knowledge of solar energy conversion processes in two-
dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as monolayer (ML) MoS . These ultrathin semiconductors
2
have unique physical and photophysical properties that could make hot-carrier energy
conversion possible. Electrochemical microscopy and in situ ultrafast spectroscopy will be used
to interrogate the rate of hot-carrier cooling relative to the rate of hot-carrier extraction in
photoelectrochemical cells based on ML-MoS . The solid/liquid interface in a
2
photoelectrochemical cell is an excellent model system to quantify the energy and yield of hot-
carrier extraction in 2D semiconductors. This research will produce the necessary
thermodynamic and kinetic data to understand rate-limiting processes involved in the transfer
of high-potential electrons to substrates or catalysts for solar fuels production. The research
outcomes will have broad impact in electrochemical research including electrocatalysis, energy
storage, and artificial photosystems for harvesting solar energy.

Robust Dark Energy Constraints with Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey
Dr. Lado Samushia, Assistant Professor

Manhattan, KS 66506
Dark Energy is one of the biggest mysteries of modern science. We know that it makes up
about 70 percent of the Universe but we don’t have a satisfactory theory for its fundamental
nature. Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is an experiment that aims to study
properties of Dark Energy with extremely high accuracy. DESI will observe millions of distant
galaxies and measure the rate of the Universe's expansion and the growth of structure by
analyzing statistical patterns in the spatial distribution of those galaxies. The objective of this
project is to extract information about Dark Energy from galaxies observed by DESI by pursuing
three complementary approaches. The first approach will study the relationship between
galaxies and their host dark matter halos by means of various nonlinear statistical measures and
machine learning techniques. The second approach will link the properties of Dark Energy to the
magnitude of infall velocities between galaxies at small separations by means of computer
simulations. The third approach will look for large scale harmonic patterns in higher-order
statistics of galaxy distribution that are sensitive to the properties of Dark Energy. This program
will enable us to extract robust and precise measurements of the properties of Dark Energy from
DESI data.

Additive-Assisted Preparation of Multinary Halides
Dr. Bayrammurad Saparov, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
University of Oklahoma
Norman, OK 73019
Global interest in the use of halides for optoelectronic applications including
photovoltaics (PV), photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and thin-film transistors
has been revived due to the emergence of high-performance solar cells based on lead halide
perovskites. The rapid development of optoelectronic metal halides was aided by their solution
processing, which enables greater chemical flexibility, richer chemical compositions, and crystal
structures. In turn, the rich chemistry of metal halides translates into a wide tunability of physical
properties, allowing their consideration for a variety of energy-saving technologies. However, a
fundamental understanding of the solution preparation of metal halides, particularly in the
presence of spectator ions, is lacking. This project aims to prepare a series of metastable
multinary halides through understanding and control of impurity-assisted solution synthesis.
Self-assembly of ordered (i.e., crystalline) materials in polar media has already yielded large
classes of energy-relevant materials. Expanding the experimental toolset available to materials
chemists, this project will specifically focus on using reactive and non-reactive metal halide
additives to reaction media to obtain multinary halides that are otherwise inaccessible.

Next Generation of QCD Global Analysis for Hadronic Physics
Dr. Nobuo Sato, Nathan Isgur Fellow in Nuclear Theory
Center for Theoretical and Computational Physics
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
Newport News, VA 23602
Understanding the internal structure of protons and neutrons, which are the fundamental
building blocks of atomic nuclei and thus of all the stars, planets and most visible matter in the
universe, is one of mankind’s major challenges. With more than 50 years of experimental and
theoretical effort, we now understand that protons and neutrons (or collectively “nucleons”) are
composed of more fundamental quark constituents bound together by gluons with strong forces
governed by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Unlike any other known
phenomenon in Nature, the confinement property of QCD means that quarks and gluons can
never be observed in isolation in any particle detector. Moreover, in contrast to other systems,
such as atoms or molecules, there is no “still” picture for the internal quark and gluon structure
of nucleons and nuclei, and the internal structure can only be characterized through quantum
correlation functions (QCFs), such as parton distribution functions, transverse momentum
dependent distributions, and generalized parton distributions. The greatest challenge is
therefore to map out these QCFs using data from experiments that only detect particles such as
hadrons, photons and leptons. With the ongoing 12 GeV nuclear physics program at Jefferson
Lab, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab, and other facilities around
the world, as well as the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in the US, we are at the threshold of
imaging the nucleon’s internal 3-dimensional quark and gluon structure in the theoretical
framework of QCD for the first time. The new facilities will deliver unprecedented quantities of
high-precision data, posing new opportunities and challenges for accessing a variety of QCFs. The
goal of this project is to meet these challenges by developing the next generation QCD
“FemtoAnalyzer” to assimilate information about various types of QCFs from experimental data
at the femtometer scale. The project integrates modern developments in nuclear theory, data
handling and artificial intelligence to develop the most advanced theoretical and
phenomenological tools to visualize the internal landscape of nucleons and nuclei with
unprecedented resolution. The achievements of this project will help to accomplish the mission
of DOE’s Nuclear Physics program to analyze the enormous amounts of data from the Jefferson
Lab 12 GeV and future EIC facilities.

The QCD Structure of Nucleons and Light Nuclei
Dr. Phiala Shanahan, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
Atomic nuclei, built of protons and neutrons, constitute more than 99% of the visible mass
in our universe. Quantitatively describing the structure of protons, neutrons, and nuclei in terms
of their quark and gluon constituents is a defining challenge bridging hadronic and nuclear
physics research. The ultimate goal is to map the complete spatial, momentum, spin, flavor, and
gluon structure of the proton and neutron, to be able to predict their interactions and resonances
precisely, and to understand how their structures change as they form a nucleus. Not only is this
map the key to interpreting observations of nature in terms of the currently-accepted
fundamental theory, but it is essential to inform searches for new physics. This research program
furthers this mission by revealing aspects of the gluon structure of the proton, and of the quark
and gluon structure of light nuclei, using first-principles calculations of the strong interactions.
The results will provide essential information for current and future nuclear physics experimental
programs, in particular those at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and at the
planned Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The results will also provide
input to nuclear physics experiments searching for violation of fundamental symmetries and new
physics, including laboratory-based experiments searching for dark matter.

Towards Exact Finite Temperature Electronic Structure in Solids and Molecules
Dr. James Shepherd, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Iowa
Iowa City, IA 52242
Materials with temperature-dependent properties are familiar to us. For example, room-
temperature magnets can lose their magnetism if heated too much. The temperature range over
which materials will exhibit a desirable property is an important feature when it comes to their
design. While macroscopic properties are driven by a wide variety of competing physical effects,
one consideration is that temperature can cause changes in how electrons interact with one
another. In quantum mechanics, this is represented by there being a large number of excited
states that electrons can arrange themselves in, leading to a high degree of complexity. High-
accuracy calculations that aim to solve the Schrödinger equation can, in principle, resolve this
complicated mixture of states within a material and find exact electronic properties at a target
temperature. However, until now, the simulations required would be too expensive even on the
fastest supercomputers. This project will develop more affordable ways to perform exact
calculations to isolate and measure how electronic structure changes with temperature. It will
leverage and adapt an algorithm that randomly samples quantum-mechanical electronic states
to achieve exact-on-average energies and property predictions, which are useful for a significant
number of practical purposes. Through a combination of developing new software and models,
this research will also provide mechanistic detail for thermal electronic effects in plasmonics as
well as in phase transitions. The software and data developed will be open-sourced and made
available to a new and growing community of researchers looking to adapt ground-state
simulations to account for electronic temperature.

Exploring the Energy Frontier through Precision Tests and Fast Tracking with the CMS
Detector
Dr. Louise Skinnari, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Northeastern University
Boston, MA 02115
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been remarkably successful in explaining
experimental data, yet it is known to be an incomplete theory. Several key features of our
universe remain unexplained, including the nature of dark matter, the observed matter-
antimatter asymmetry, and the origin of the large difference between the electroweak and
Planck energy scales. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s most energetic particle
accelerator complex, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland
provides an extremely powerful tool to address these fundamental questions. This research
program plans to utilize data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the
LHC to probe physics phenomena beyond the SM. This work will exploit the heaviest known
elementary particles — the top quark and the Higgs boson — to advance our understanding of
interactions between fundamental particles. Specifically, the research includes searching for
lepton-flavor violating interactions that are forbidden in the SM and characterizing in greater
detail the coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson at high energies. Complementing
these studies, the program also entails developing fast reconstruction of trajectories of charged
particles traversing the CMS detector (“tracks”), thereby maximizing the physics potential of the
future High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) running period. The inclusion of track reconstruction in the
CMS hardware-based collision filtering system, implemented with field programmable gate array
technologies, is a novel experimental tool that will enhance sensitivity to the unique physics
signatures under study. Overall, the program is both critical for the core goals of the CMS
experiment at the HL-LHC and has the potential to enable entirely new searches for phenomena
beyond the SM, such as tracing long-lived particles from exotic decays of the Higgs boson.

A major problem in theoretical physics is to develop a complete theory of quantum
gravity. This is needed to address basic questions, such as: "what happened before the big bang?"
and "is space-time fundamental?'" Many important aspects of quantum gravity can be studied in
the context of black hole physics. The research in this project will begin there, seeking to find the
origin of the underlying quantum discreteness of a black hole. In other words: what makes a
quantum black hole really "quantum"? In a second phase of the project, lessons learned from the
black hole setting will be applied to the context of cosmology and the big bang. Throughout, a
focus will be on strengthening the deep ties between quantum gravity and quantum information
science.

Simulating estuarine wetland function: Nitrogen removal, carbon sequestration, and
greenhouse gas fluxes at the river-land-ocean interface
Dr. Benjamin N. Sulman, R&D Staff
Environmental Sciences Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37831
Estuaries are characterized by interactions between freshwater from rivers and saltwater
from the ocean, which drives high ecosystem productivity and dynamic carbon and nutrient
cycling. Estuaries can act as a filter on river inputs of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients to the ocean
and can greatly reduce the amount of N that moves from rivers to the ocean. Estuarine wetlands
sequester carbon (C) at high rates due to rapid vegetation growth fueled by abundant water and
nutrients combined with waterlogged sediment conditions that slow decomposition. Estuarine
wetlands can also be significant sources of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.
However, estuaries and estuarine wetlands are not currently represented in Earth System Models
(ESMs) such as the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). By omitting estuarine wetland
processes, models likely overestimate N inputs from rivers to the coastal ocean and
underestimate C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in coastal regions. This research
aims to understand the current and future role of estuarine wetlands in coastal C and N cycling
at scales from the estuary landscape to the continental coast by simulating estuarine wetland
processes in the E3SM Land Model. Model improvements will include developing chemical and
biological interactions in wetland sediments and introducing salt marsh and mangrove vegetation
types. Model developments will be evaluated using observational data from existing coastal
wetland field sites along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States. This
research will enable quantitative estimates of N removal, C sequestration, and greenhouse gas
emissions from estuarine wetlands at estuary to continental scales and improve predictions of
coastal C and N cycling responses to changes in wetland area, river flows, and sea levels.

Elucidating Chirality-induced Magnetism and Magnetoelectric Functionalities
in Layered Chiral Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskites
Dr. Dali Sun, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
North Carolina State University
Raleigh, NC 27695
The ability to generate and manipulate spin information is essential in spintronics, which
utilizes the electron’s spin degree of freedom instead of its charge to transfer and process
information. Multiferroic materials exhibit multiple ferroic orders, i.e., ferroelectricity and
ferromagnetism. The multiple ordered states and their magnetoelectric coupling empower the
direct control of the magnetization by an electric field and vice versa. 2D layered Hybrid Metal
Halides (2D-HMHs) are a new class of synthetic semiconductors prepared by low-temperature
solution processing with a large chemical and structural ‘universe’ benefiting from their synthetic
versatility. By implanting chiral organic cations into the HMH superstructure, the 2D-chiral-HMH
would simultaneously exhibit ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and magnetoelectric functionalities
stemming from a Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect that may not be subject to
thermal fluctuations. This proposal aims to elucidate the fundamental origins of chirality-induced
magnetism via the CISS effect and their electrical tunability in 2D-chiral-HMH material systems.
Two ultrasensitive detection themes based on spin-orbitronics and magneto-optics will be
developed for probing the CISS-induced magnetism and magnetoelectric functionalities in this
hybrid material. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for understanding the origin of
the multiferroic functionality in chiral-based hybrid materials under multiple external stimuli,
heralding a paradigm shift in the generation and manipulation of spin information using solution-
processed, flexible hybrid materials without the need for magnetic elements.

Temperature-Time-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams for Predictive Solid-State Ceramic
Synthesis
Dr. Wenhao Sun, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, MI 48105
Exciting new energy materials are routinely being predicted in silico, but their realization
in the laboratory is often bottlenecked by the laborious, trial-and-error nature of materials
synthesis. Developing a predictive theory of synthesis requires a better understanding of non-
equilibrium reaction byproducts—which appear ubiquitously during synthesis, but are difficult to
anticipate within existing theoretical frameworks. This research aims to unify classical
thermodynamics, nucleation, diffusion, and crystal growth theories to predict Temperature-
Time-Transformation (TTT) diagrams for solid-state ceramic synthesis. These TTT diagrams will
capture crucial features in the kinetic evolution of ceramic powder precursors; including reaction
sequence, reaction onset temperature, phase decomposition, liquid formation, and metastable
intermediates. Guided by these TTT diagrams, a solid-state chemist can more rationally navigate
through the thermodynamic and kinetic energy landscape towards the phase-pure synthesis of
target materials. This research will proceed by three milestones: 1) Developing fast and accurate
ab initio predictions of the high-temperature region of the phase diagram, at a computational
expense low enough to be integrated into high-throughput materials design workflows. 2)
Deriving new kinetic models for the sequential interfacial reactions that occur throughout a
heterogeneous mixture of precursor powders. 3) Validation and refinement of the TTT formalism
against text-mined synthesis recipes from the literature, and in a collaborative 4D
nanotomography characterization of microstructure evolution during solid-state synthesis. Our
ambition is to deliver TTT diagrams as a new and indispensable tool into the toolkit of the
preparative solid-state chemist.

Predictive multiscale modeling and simulations have the potential to be revolutionized by
data-driven, scientific machine learning approaches. However, such next-generation scientific
machine learning models must demonstrate robustness, physics compatibility, and satisfy
additional requirements compared to their traditional machine learning counterparts if they are
meant to tackle high-consequence applications of interest to the DOE. We unify concepts from
traditional multiphysics simulation with graph neural network architectures to obtain a machine
learning framework able to guarantee preservation of important physical invariants crucial to
handling problems from mechanics and electromagnetics. In this manner, physics are engineered
directly into the neural network, guaranteeing desirable properties even in small data limits. A
diverse selection of exemplar problems drives this foundational research, including: co-design of
microelectronic devices, resilient energy storage systems, and the study of discrete fracture
networks in subsurface flows.

Accurate Dark Energy Constraints via the Precise Characterization of Galaxy Intrinsic
Alignment Coupled with Shear and Redshift Interference
Dr. Michael A. Troxel, Assistant Professor
Physics Department
Duke University
Durham, NC 27705
One of the most fundamental mysteries we face in physics is understanding what the
nature of the dark energy component of our Universe is that causes the accelerated expansion
of space. A powerful way to study dark energy is via weak gravitational lensing due to large-scale
structure in the Universe, which we observe as tiny distortions in the shapes of very distant
galaxies due to the bending of light by foreground mass. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Vera
C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) were designed to enable
unprecedented measurements of these distortions in the shapes of galaxies to study dark energy.
The intrinsic shapes of galaxies before they are distorted by weak gravitational lensing can cancel
out some of the effects of lensing to obscure or bias what we infer about the nature of dark
energy. This research program will lead to improved image-level simulations of the DES and Rubin
Observatory LSST data, built using state-of-the-art methods like machine learning. These
simulations will make it possible to fully characterize the cosmic impact of these intrinsic shapes
on weak gravitational lensing. This work will inform crucial improvements in methodology for
studying dark energy with weak gravitational lensing at the precision promised by the final DES
data and the Rubin Observatory LSST in the 2020s.

A Multiresolution Sharp-interface Framework for Tightly-coupled Multiphysics Simulations
Dr. Wim M. van Rees, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
An important subset of energy-related systems in fluid mechanics, geophysics, and
industrial applications can be modeled as interface-coupled multiphysics problems. For these
problems, the accurate prediction of system properties near moving boundaries and interfaces
is a valuable capability that enables optimization of sensor placements, analysis of structural
loadings, and many other insights. Significant modeling and algorithmic challenges stem from the
wide range and scale separations of time and space in each domain, the large motions and
deformations of the interface separating the domains, and the coupling between the different
domains across such moving interfaces. This proposal aims to overcome these challenges by
combining a high-fidelity treatment of sharp moving interfaces with a localized tight coupling
strategy. The research from this novel paradigm will be implemented within a scalable
multiresolution software framework. Testing and validation will be carried out on two
representative applications: two-phase incompressible flows and fluid-structure interactions.

Atomic Resolution of Lignin-Carbohydrate Interactions in Native Plant Tissues from Solid-
State NMR
Dr. Tuo Wang, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Louisiana State University
Baton Rouge, LA 70803
The carbon-rich plant cell wall is a sophisticated composite of macromolecules, with a
highly complex structure that is beyond the level that humans can artificially produce. The
secondary plant cell wall comprises the majority of biomass and serves as the central source for
biofuel, biomaterial, and high-value bioproducts. The interactions between the phenolic polymer
lignin and polysaccharides make the biomass recalcitrant to post-harvest processing but the
physical nature of these polymer interactions is not well understood. The biomolecules in their
cellular environment are often insoluble, non-crystalline, and structurally polymorphic, thus
evading high-resolution characterization. The primary objective of this project is to overcome the
technical bottleneck by developing a biophysical toolbox that enables atomic-level investigations
of cellulose, hemicellulose (xylan and glucomannan), and lignin using native stems of Arabidopsis,
maize, poplar, and spruce. We will resolve the physical packing and covalent linkages of lignin
and polysaccharides and understand their heterogeneous hydrophobicity and dynamics in
whole-cell samples. Comparing wild-type samples with lignin-engineered, transgenic plants will
uncover the molecular principles involved in biopolymer interactions and supramolecular
assembly. The fundamental knowledge will advance our understanding of energy storage in
plants, form the foundation for optimizing the utility of lignocellulose for energy and biomaterial,
and inspire the rational design of synthetic polymers and composites with tunable structure and
properties. The biophysical methods established here will enable investigations of many energy-
relevant systems such as plants, algae, microbes, as well as carbon-rich materials and polymers.

Enhancing Performance of Bosonic Qubits in Circuit QED with Reservoir Engineering
Dr. Chen Wang, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Hadley, MA 01035
Quantum information technologies are built from a collection of physical qubits (quantum
bits) and seek to use their superpositions and entangled states to process information. A central
challenge for their development is the fragility of qubits: All qubits incur random errors due to
undesirable interactions with their dissipative environment, a process known as decoherence.
The common approaches for suppressing quantum errors have focused on device-level isolation
from the environment and software-level implementation of quantum error correction codes.
Recently, an intermediate and unifying approach emerges from the progress in “quantum
reservoir engineering”. Surprisingly, the environmental interaction can be tailored, rather than
eliminated, to provide the equivalent of a restoring force to the qubits, which can stabilize
quantum superpositions and even passively correct errors in encoded logical qubits.
The goal of this research is to experimentally establish a paradigm of using engineered
dissipation to reduce errors in the storage and manipulation of qubits. We employ a leading
candidate platform for quantum computation, the superconducting circuit QED, where we
choose to use 3D superconducting microwave cavity oscillators as qubits. More specifically, we
encode logical qubits in the bosonic states of the cavities with a specific photon number parity,
and use standard Josephson circuits known as transmons as ancillas for quantum control. The
project builds on our initial demonstration of a parity-recovery dissipation operator capable of
autonomously reversing cavity photon loss without the large quantum and classical resource
overhead needed for active error correction. The dissipative process will be systematically
characterized, refined, and integrated with other stabilization schemes and unitary control,
leading to improved logical qubit lifetime and logical gate fidelity. If successful, this project
establishes these self-stabilized individual qubits and gates as improved building blocks for
generic intermediate scale applications of quantum computing without the need of large-scale
error correction.

This project addresses complex design, decision, and control problems that do not readily
admit a closed-form algebraic description. Such problems often rely on information from “black

Electrodes
Dr. Huolin Xin, Assistant Professor

University of California
Irvine, CA 92697
The development of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) is one of the key innovations in the past
several decades that have revolutionized many aspects of our lives and changed how we interact
with machines and the environment. However, building safe, high-energy, long cycle-life and low-
cost batteries is still a challenge for the research community. Many of the long-standing issues in
the field are due in part to the lack of characterization tools to resolve the electrode materials’
failure modes and degradation mechanisms. The central goal of this research project is to
develop machine learning-enabled low-dose and chemically sensitive atomic-resolution electron
tomography as well as high temporal resolution electron nanotomography to reveal novel
phenomena related to the dynamic evolution of the surfaces and interfaces in LIB electrodes.
This project will result in three-dimensional imaging of atomic species, bonding, and electronic
structures at the atomic scale as well as unprecedented sub-10-second temporal resolution for
probing battery materials’ transformation dynamics. When realized, this technique will offer a
significant improvement in electron tomography’s capability in imaging chemistry as well as
temporal resolution compared to the state of the art and will offer opportunities to directly
visualize transformations of electrode materials in energy storage devices during electrochemical
reactions. These new capabilities will impact materials characterizations at the sub-nanometer
scale beyond battery materials.

Deciphering and Manipulating Low Dimensional Magnetism
Dr. Ming Yi, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
Rice University
Houston, TX 77005
The ultimate success of materials by design depends critically on our ability to accurately
predict material properties from first principle theories. For materials with weak electron-
electron interactions, such efforts have been largely successful due to the ability of Density
Functional Theory to correctly predict electric and optical properties in real materials. However,
most materials with exotic quantum phenomena exhibit non-negligible many-body effects for
which material property prediction is still largely limited. Such is the case of two-dimensional
magnetism recently realized in a class of van der Waals materials that exhibit diverse electric and
optical properties with rich potential to become platforms for versatile novel devices. This
proposal aims to bridge the gap between first principle calculations and electric and optical
properties of these two-dimensional magnetic materials via measurement of the single-particle
spectral function by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The main goals of this ressearch
are to i) provide fundamental physics knowledge of the origin of the magnetism in the three-
dimensional versions of the bulk materials, ii) understand how key ingredients for magnetism
evolve from the three-dimensional limit towards the two-dimensional regime, and iii) investigate
the effect of external perturbations and tunability of the magnetism by directly measuring the
electronic response when subject to different environments. The methodologies developed here
will benefit the explorations of a broader class of correlated materials for both fundamental
science and potential applications.

Quantum Performance Enhancement
Dr. Kevin C. Young, Principal Research Scientist
Sandia National Laboratories
Livermore, CA 94550
Despite their exquisite engineering, quantum information processors (QIPs) are
exceptionally susceptible to interference from their environments. The grand challenge of
experimental quantum computing is to reduce the rate at which errors appear in computations
to below a threshold where useful algorithms become feasible. But today’s QIPs are limited –
sometimes even crippled – by calibration errors. Qubits, quantum processors, and the classical
systems that control them are sensitive to a surprisingly large set of adjustable parameters. All
of them need to be tuned and calibrated very precisely – and then recalibrated as conditions
change – to keep errors from overrunning computations. But today’s most widely used
techniques to tune and maintain control parameters are ad hoc and inefficient. They don’t
leverage modern quantum computing theory, or recent breakthroughs in error characterization.
This research will solve this fundamental performance-limiting problem by developing fast and
efficient calibration methods that work for all qubit technologies and can operate efficiently at
scale. The results of this project will enable QIPs to maximize their potential for near-term
computational advantage and catalyze progress towards the DOE’s goal of realizing QIPs able to
significantly advance scientific discovery.

Multi-kHz Laser-plasma Accelerator Driven by Spectrally Combined Fiber Laser
Dr. Tong Zhou, Research Scientist

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley , CA 94720
Particle accelerators are critical instruments for discoveries and applications in high-
energy physics and across science and industry. Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) could greatly
reduce the sizes and costs of future particle accelerators, by using laser-driven plasma structures
that produce very high accelerating gradients, but increased repetition rate is needed to enable
applications. While fiber lasers are considered one of the most promising solutions to drive high
repetition-rate LPAs, the optical pulses produced from existing fiber lasers are too long. This
research addresses the gap between the limited pulse durations of existing fiber lasers and LPA
application needs, using a novel pulse duration reduction approach. This research will develop a
fiber laser system with a spectral combination architecture that delivers energetic ultrashort
optical pulses to drive an LPA, and will demonstrate high repetition-rate LPA operations at
multiple kilohertz, where an accelerator control system will be implemented based on fast
feedback including machine learning. The laser and LPA technologies developed under this
research can enable many applications using high repetition-rate electron beams including those
in science and medicine, and with further scaling of laser pulse energy can enable the path to
future laser-driven particle colliders.
This research was selected for funding by the Office of High Energy Physics.
