Energy-efficient Neuromorphic Technologies for Scientific Computing
Dr. Gina C. Adam, Assistant Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Large artificial intelligence models supported by digital architectures are facing a memory and power
efficiency wall. Models with trillions of parameters need supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of
processors and GWh of energy per training, a financial and environmental cost that is unstainable
beyond-exascale. The current digital hardware is orders of magnitude less efficient than computation
performed by the brain. Recent neuroscience studies emphasize that the characteristic structure of the
brain networks is key to reducing the energetic costs of computation in the brain. New brain-inspired
computing approaches and new analog hardware are needed to bridge the gap. This project draws
inspiration from the hippocampus, a core brain region that supports learning, memory and navigation,
to develop networks that can perform learning and adaptation at scale in an energy efficient fashion and
under limited hardware constraints. Two key concepts from neuroscience, i.e. spontaneous resting-state
dynamics and cell assemblies, seem to underpin the efficiency, self-regulation and robustness to noise
and variability of the biological neuronal circuits. In this work, they will be explored in an integrative
fashion using biologically-plausible models with a goal towards analog circuit translation. The research is
driven by three main objectives and uses neuronal models derived from the rodent hippocampus, one of
the most studied brain regions. The emergence of spontaneous resting-state dynamics in hardware-
relevant network models will be investigated. The results will be utilized to explore energy efficient cell
assemblies formation in such networks. The algorithmic insights will be translated to neuromorphic
circuits that have resting-state dynamics and pattern classification capabilities. In conjunction with
transistor circuitry tape-outs, novel analog devices with tunable time constants will be investigated to
support the neuronal and synaptic diversity in the biologically-realistic system. This project will bring
neuroscience insights to develop neuromorphic technology capable of analyzing large and/or
incomplete data of relevance to DOE in an energy-efficient, fast and robust way.

A High-Luminosity Active Nuclear Target for Recoil Tagging Measurements
Dr. Whitney Armstrong, Assistant Physicist
Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Understanding the quark and gluon substructure of helium-4 – a light, and tightly-bound nucleus – is a
fundamental goal of nuclear physics. The properties of helium-4 emerging from the dynamics of quarks
and gluons can be studied in electron beam scattering experiments where the helium-4 remains intact.
These experiments require the scattered electron, the low energy recoiling helium-4 nucleus, and any
additional produced particles to be detected simultaneously amid a high radiation background. This
project will explore and develop a novel active helium-4 target as a detector system based on linear
arrays of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and cryogenic readout
technology. Significant R&D will be conducted to demonstrate a prototype of this first-of-its-kind
concept of a cryogenic target system operating as a novel “photon time projection chamber”. Such a
transformative target system could be used in high beam intensity experiments at Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), including the proposed Solenoidal Large Intensity Device (SoLID)
experiment. The project will make use of state-of-the-art micro-fabrication materials and accelerator
test facilities at Argonne National Laboratory.

Toward Quantum Imaging of Nuclei
Dr. Miguel Arratia, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy
University of California, Riverside
Riverside, CA 92507
The atomic nucleus emerges from interacting quantum particles called quarks and gluons, but how this
happens remains unknown. This might be elucidated with quantum-level "images" of their position,
orbital motion, spin alignment, and entanglement. This quantum imaging represents a cornerstone at
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. This project will extend this research from its current
focus on studying isolated protons and neutrons to the realm of complex nuclei, where theoretical
models hint at new phenomena. Experiments will use a high-intensity, high-energy electron beam to
probe a wide range of nuclear targets, from lithium to lead. Key studies will involve measuring the
angles of the scattered electrons and other particles and how they depend on the spin state of electrons
or nuclei. This project seeks to establish a solid experimental foundation for the quantum imaging of the
atomic nucleus.

Deciphering Complex Chemical Reaction Dynamics Induced by
Non-Equilibrium Microplasma Discharges at High Pressures
Dr. Sayan Biswas, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering
University of Minnesota
Minneapolis, MN 55455
Microplasma, confined to dimensions on the scale of millimeters or smaller, demonstrates remarkable
stability even under high pressures, facilitating self-sustained and continuous operation. This stability is
attributed to the efficient energy transfer within the confined space, leading to heightened ionization
and excitation processes. With their cost-effectiveness, ease of operation, simplified hardware design,
and portability, microplasmas find applications across diverse fields, including materials processing,
sensing, energy generation, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis. Understanding the
intricate dynamics of ions, electrons, metastable species, and excited atomic and molecular species
within transient streamers and early afterglow regimes of microplasma, particularly under atmospheric
and above-atmospheric pressures, is imperative for unlocking its potential in complex reaction
dynamics. At elevated pressures, where the electron mean free path approaches the inter-electrode
gap, quenching processes emerge as dominant factors.
The proposed research endeavors to delve into electron-impact ionization and fragmentation of
molecules, such as methane and ammonia, within the microplasma environment. Additionally, the
investigation will explore the influence of Rydberg molecules on plasma chemistry and subsequent
chemical reactions. This research aims to unveil novel chemical pathways in gas-phase systems by
harnessing the unique characteristics of electrons, ions, and Rydberg molecules within a high-pressure
non-equilibrium microplasma. Over a five-year span, the research trajectory will commence with
focused studies on well-established gases like helium and/or argon during the initial two years.
Subsequently, the scope will expand to encompass investigations into air, methane, and ammonia
systems, particularly in the context of energy applications, in the latter three years. Through this
progressive approach, the research aims to deepen our understanding of microplasma chemistry and its
potential for transformative applications in various domains.

Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Cares?
Using Soil Microbial Demographics to Predict Carbon Transformation
Dr. Steven J Blazewicz, Research Scientist
Nuclear and Chemical Sciences Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
Due to their abundance and ubiquitousness, microorganisms shape the Earth’s global cycles of
important nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus as they reproduce and die over time.
Fundamental aspects of these processes can be studied by culturing individual microbes in the
laboratory. However, measuring these processes in wild microbial communities that cannot be cultured
has proved challenging until recently. This project aims to significantly advance our understanding of
microbial population growth and mortality rates and their critical roles in soil biogeochemical cycles,
especially carbon cycling. The project employs high throughput approaches to test if and how microbes
utilize a broad diversity of carbon compounds that mimic those found in their natural soil habitat.
Different “omics” analyses are conducted on soils from multiple incubations along with a technique
called quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) to track microbial activities and the fate of organic
compounds as they are utilized and modified by the microbes. One of the goals of the project is to
develop a publicly accessible, comprehensive qSIP database to enable advanced analysis of microbial
growth and mortality while taking into account the environmental conditions at the time of each
experiment. Sophisticated computational and machine learning approaches are used to test and refine
ecological theories across different ecosystems. This endeavor is expected to offer critical insights into
how carbon substrates affect microbial processes, influencing soil organic matter dynamics and carbon
storage. Through its innovative approach and integration of multiple data types, this research will fill
critical knowledge gaps and contribute essential data for quantitative models that link microbial activity
to broad-scale ecological processes. Ultimately, this project's findings could lead to improved soil
management strategies and carbon sequestration techniques, and aid in efforts to mitigate climate
change by enhancing soil health and productivity.

Multi-channel access to Generalized Parton Distributions
Dr. Marie Boër, Assistant Professor
Physics Department
Virginia Technical University
Blacksburg, VA 24061
This project aims to explore the multidimensional structure of the nucleon (proton or neutron) in terms
of its internal constituents, called “partons” (quarks and gluons), from an experimental and
phenomenological point of view. Several new and dedicated experiments will be developed at Jefferson
Lab Hall C. Experimental data will be analyzed to expand the global data accessing Generalized Parton
Distributions (GPDs), which are functions parametrizing this internal structure. GPDs contain the relation
between parton’s longitudinal momentum and transverse position. The final step will be to produce
multi-channel/multi-observable fits of functions of the GPDs. What is unique in this approach is that
novel reactions that will be measured will access for the first-time kinematics enabling a 3-dimensional
interpretation (“tomography”) of the quark and gluon distributions. These measurements will also
enable assessing whether GPDs are universal functions, a milestone in nuclear physics. This project will
involve experimental work: detector R&D and assembly, simulations, data taking, data analysis; and
phenomenological work: impact studies, interpretation of the results, fits and modeling, and
development of event generators. It will have a major impact on assessing GPDs’ universality, bringing
new and independent constraints to GPD models, constraining the full kinematic phase-space of the
GPDs, which is needed for tomographic interpretations, and obtaining novel information on the spatial
and momentum distributions of quarks in the nucleon.

Attosecond Metrology for Electron and X-ray Beams
Dr. David Cesar, Associate Staff Scientist
Accelerator Research Division
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, CA, 94025
Probing the rapid motion of electrons within molecules requires making measurements on an
attosecond timescale. Recently, free electron lasers facilities (FELs) have developed powerful attosecond
x-ray sources by selectively lasing on a single spike within a much longer electron beam. The single-spike
FEL operates in a novel regime where the x-rays develop partial longitudinal coherence due to slippage
effects. The coherence implies a stable, seed-like structure (relative to the electron beam), which can be
used to shape the x-ray pulse in downstream amplification stages. In principle, this enables attosecond
pulses with higher peak power, two colors, improved stability, and shorter pulse lengths. But the physics
underlying this process remains largely unexplored, because diagnostics capable of resolving the FEL
instability on an attosecond timescale do not exist. This program will build a photoelectron streaking
diagnostic in which the space-charge field of the electron beam provides the streaking momentum.
Because the same electron beam is used both to generate and to streak the x-rays, the diagnostic will be
intrinsically synchronous and able to reconstruct the first-order coherence properties of the x-ray beam.
Such synchronous metrology is required to directly access the physics of a single-spike FEL, and the
insights learned will help push the boundaries of FEL performance. Shot-by-shot information from the
new diagnostic can then be used for online optimization of attosecond FELs.

Phosphine-Modified Cationic Co(II) Precatalysts for Hydroformylation at Mild Conditions
Dr. Matthew B. Chambers, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Louisiana State University
Baton Rouge, LA 70803
Carbon monoxide is a cheap and abundant carbon source used to produce fuels and various
commodities. While historically produced through energy-intensive processes such as steam-reforming,
advances in CO production from biomass gasification and via CO2 reduction allow for CO to be now
viewed as a renewable carbon source. The capture and conversion of carbon to generate products
critical to society (fuels, polymers, pharmaceuticals) remain a significant scientific challenge for the
21st century. Toward the goal of lowering carbon emissions, the efficient use of CO represents a
lynchpin between renewable sources of carbon and producing the commodities on which we rely.
However, many of the large-scale processes that leverage CO demand high temperatures and pressures
and have large energy demands. One of the largest is hydroformylation, which converts alkenes, H2, and
CO into aldehydes at over 10 million metric tons annually. Discovered nearly 100 years ago, this process
is commercially catalyzed by either Co(I) or Rh(I) carbonyl complexes, sometimes supported by ancillary
phosphine ligands. Whereas Co(I) catalysts have the advantage of being based on an earth-abundant
metal, higher temperatures and pressures are required, and decomposition to Co metal can yield alkene
hydrogenation side reactions, which have little value. Rh catalysts are active at lower pressures (30
bar vs 100 bar) but inherently use precious metals while also suffering from their decomposition
pathways. Recently, a Co(II) precatalyst for hydroformylation was discovered with unique properties.
The resulting catalysis occurs at milder conditions, with activity near that of Rh(I), no decomposition is
reported, and minimal alkene hydrogenation is observed. These new precatalysts have the potential to
use cheap Co-based catalysts to achieve conditions similar to Rh and with comparable rates. However,
as Co(II) hydroformylation precatalysts remain an emerging class of complexes, little is known about
controlling the reactivity and the nature of the active catalytic species.
In this project, we seek to develop this novel Co(II) precatalyst further. We will determine the structure
of the active catalyst through various in situ spectroscopic methods. We will create a structure/activity
relationship to elucidate the key features of the ligand field that are critical to catalytic activity and
selectivity. We will also expand the principles of the Co(II) systems to comparable base metals of
intermediate oxidation states. The goal of this work is to identify the key structural and electronic
factors that allow Co(II) precatalysts to generate these unique hydroformylation catalysts. It will also
represent the initial efforts to broaden the scope of catalyst reactivity to other base metal complexes.
More broadly, this work will advance the development of base metal catalysts and our understanding of
how precatalysts of intermediate oxidation states can yield active and metastable catalysts under
reducing conditions.

Observing and understanding the role of surface thermal heterogeneity in mesoscale circulations over
AMF3 BNF: Implications for land-atmosphere interactions
Dr. Nathaniel Chaney, Assistant Professor
Civil and Environmental Engineering
Duke University
Durham, NC 27708
When thermal heterogeneity over the land surface is sufficiently pronounced and organized (on the
order of kms), it can drive the development of mesoscale circulations which, in turn, can impact
boundary layer and cloud development. The realization that these secondary circulations can play a
larger role than expected in the climate system is driving a push to improve the sub-grid heterogeneous
land-atmosphere coupling in Earth system models. As new coupling parameterizations emerge, there is
a need to improve understanding of these circulations and how they are driven by the underlying
surface physical environment. Furthermore, it is critical to develop metrics to compare existing
observations to evaluate the modeled thermal spatial patterns and the circulations. The third
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility in the Bankhead National Forest (AMF3
BNF) provides a unique opportunity to address this need, as it provides an environmental setup that
combines spatially organized heterogeneities in soils, land cover, and topography; it has a climate and
environment that is favorable for locally driven shallow cumulus clouds; and it has a network of Doppler
lidars that makes it plausible to observe the circulations. The overarching objective of this project is to
leverage AMF3 BNF to improve understanding of the role of thermal surface heterogeneity in mesoscale
circulations. To accomplish this goal, this project will 1) leverage observations to determine the
connection between thermal surface heterogeneity and mesoscale circulations; 2) assemble a digital
twin of the AMF3 BNF region using Large Eddy Simulations and land surface modeling and compare to
observations; 3) perform a sensitivity analysis to understand how the surface drivers of spatial
heterogeneity influence the secondary circulations and how these circulations, in turn, impact the
surface energy balance.

Coherent X-ray Detection of Quantum Correlations in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Dr. Xiaoqian Chen, Associate Physicist
Energy and Photon Sciences
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton, NY 11973
Uncovering the role of quantum correlation in electronic phase ordering is of utmost importance to
designing improved and reliable quantum materials with novel functionality. This program invests in a
new approach to identify and study quantum correlations in solids. Specifically, we will utilize state-of-
the-art synchrotron resonant coherent x-ray techniques along with laser excitations to study equilibrium
and non-equilibrium critical dynamics of electron correlations with nanometer and nanosecond
resolutions. Then quantum witness methods will be employed to quantify the degree of multipartite
entanglement from the measured dynamical structure factor. A time-resolved pump-probe capability
will be implemented at the Coherent Hard X-ray Scattering (CHX) beamline at National Synchrotron Light
Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The coherent x-ray interference patterns diffracted from
quantum materials reflect their complex spatial texture of charge and spins. By tracking the interference
pattern with time, we will gain both spatial and temporal information on phases of matter. This program
will lead to a detailed understanding of how coexisting quantum phases share the density of states at
phase boundaries, ultimately leading to the ability to design new quantum materials with stable
topological phases.

Ultrafast Terahertz Scanning Tunneling Microscopy of Atomic Defects in Complex Materials
Dr. Tyler Cocker, Assistant Professor
Physics Department
Michigan State University
East Lansing, MI 48824
In complex materials, microscopic interactions lead to surprising emergent phenomena. Among these,
the Kagome compounds are characterized by a lattice of corner-sharing triangles similar to a basket-
weave pattern in which the orientation of interacting electron spins is geometrically frustrated. This
frustration, together with electron-electron correlations and topology, leads to exotic charge density
waves and superconductivity. Atomic defects in the Kagome lattice such as single-atom vacancies may
couple to these ordered states, providing a means to both investigate their underlying cause and,
potentially, control them.
Ultrafast materials science uses impulsive excitation by laser pulses to perturb emergent order, allowing
the relevant microscopic mechanisms to be unraveled in the time domain. This research will investigate
atomic defects in Kagome materials with simultaneous atomic spatial resolution and ultrafast temporal
resolution using lightwave-driven terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM). THz-STM uses the
oscillating electric field of single-cycle THz pulses to coherently control quantum tunneling of electrons
between a tip and sample. Pump-probe THz-STM imaging experiments will capture femtosecond
snapshots of charge ordering around single-atom defects in Kagome materials following optical
excitation. Terahertz scanning tunneling spectroscopy and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy on the
atomic scale will supplement these movies by revealing the key processes underlying coupling between
the emergent order and defects. Finally, the prospect of using strong THz fields at the tip apex to locally
control the emergent order will be explored.

Broad-Spectrum Light-Harvesting and Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Nanocluster Assemblies

University of California, Irvine
Irvine, CA 92697-7600
This project advances the fundamental solar photochemistry of few-atom metal nanoclusters (NCs),
which are promising for artificial light-harvesting systems that mimic natural photosynthesis. A
significant body of theoretical work has illustrated the promise of NCs for increasing the efficiency and
range of resonance energy transfer, which is a key step in harvesting solar energy. However,
experimental studies to verify these predictions have been hindered by the major challenge of creating
well-controlled nanoscale architectures of NCs. This research overcomes this long-standing challenge by
harnessing new capabilities in bioinspired programmable assembly of DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters
(Ag -DNAs). DNA-directed atomically precise NCs architectures will be assembled using programmable
N
DNA base pairing and then experimentally investigated to understand how resonance energy transfer
efficiency is influenced by factors including the distance between NCs, as well as NC size and geometry.
Comparison of experimental results and theoretical modeling will test the hypothesis that plasmon-like
coupling can enhance resonance energy transfer between NCs. Next, the unique DNA-encoded
properties of Ag -DNAs will be used to design and assemble NC architectures for broad-spectrum light
N
harvesting and to investigate the upper limit of resonance energy transfer distance and energy down-
conversion. Finally, hybrid architectures of Ag -DNAs and carbon nanotubes will be studied to
N
understand how chirality influences energy transfer and whether NC donors can generate photoinduced
current in carbon nanotubes. This research will result in general design rules to guide the development
of NC-based materials for critical applications in solar energy harvesting and solar fuels, of interest to
the DOE Solar Photochemistry Program. This work is also expected to lead to new materials systems that
enhance the collection and transfer of solar energy.

Disentangling the factors controlling the emission of bioparticles that act as ice nucleating particles
Dr. Gavin Cornwell, Scientist
Atmospheric, Climate, and Earth Sciences Division
Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
Ice nucleating particles (INPs) affect cloud radiative properties and precipitation through their ability to
initiate primary ice formation. Primary ice formation is a critical step required for important cloud
microphysical processes that govern cloud phase and other downstream properties. Bioparticles
(defined as solid airborne particles derived from biological organisms, including microorganisms and
biological material fragments) are thought to be a key contributor to ambient INP populations in certain
regions due to their high ice nucleation activity at warm temperatures but currently are not included in
most global and regional models. Despite their importance, the identities of and factors controlling the
emission of bioparticles that act as INPs (bio-INPs), along with their downstream effects on clouds, are
not well understood.
This project seeks to improve the ability to predict INP concentrations and variability in regional and
global models by improving process understanding of bio-INP emissions using a three-part plan. First,
laboratory measurements using instruments designed to measure bioparticles and INPs will be
collected. Those measurements will be used to develop machine learning (ML) tools for classifying
bioparticles in the ambient atmosphere. Second, samples will be collected at a remote vegetated site in
the southeastern United States and returned to the laboratory for analysis. The previously developed
ML tools will be used to generate a long-term dataset of bioparticle and bio-INP concentrations with
high time resolution. Finally, the relationship between environmental factors and bioparticle and bio-
INP emissions will be examined. ML techniques will be used to analyze the dataset of ambient bio-INP
concentrations to derive and test quantitative relationships between bio-INP emissions and
environmental factors.
This project will improve the understanding of the extent to which bioparticles control warm INP
populations in the ambient atmosphere as well as identify factors that can be used to predict their
concentrations and variability. The process knowledge developed from this project will be used to
improve the emission schemes of bio-INPs, leading to increased accuracy in INP predictions by state-of-
the-art Earth system models.

Microbial Metabolic Controls on Soil Carbon Dynamics through Root-Microbe-Soil Interactions:
Connecting Molecular Processes to Ecosystem-level Impacts
Dr. Sneha P. Couvillion, Staff Scientist
Biological Sciences Division
Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
In land ecosystems, plants fix carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and convert it into organic
compounds that constitute their cell walls and other biomass components. Some of these organic
compounds are also released into the soil through the plant’s roots. The fate of this carbon fixed in plant
biomass and root deposits is determined by soil microbial communities. Microbes either degrade it and
release it back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or transform it into microbial biomass and soil
organic matter. Lipids are key components of soil organic matter and play a crucial role in microbial
metabolism. However, they are the least understood biomolecules in soil ecosystems. This project
investigates how microbial processes centered around lipids influence the persistence of carbon in soils.
Deep soils associated with bioenergy sorghum roots are being studied to identify lipid-centric microbial
strategies as well as metabolic interactions among plants, bacteria, fungi, and viruses that impact the
molecular composition and durability of soil carbon. The research integrates field observations with
laboratory experiments to identify general patterns of microbial lipid processes that affect soil organic
carbon. One of the goals of this project is to build a publicly available database of soil lipids to promote
widespread adoption of soil lipidomics and foster collaboration and sharing knowledge among the
research community. This project will advance BER's mission in bioenergy and the environment by
identifying key lipid-related microbial metabolic strategies, interkingdom interactions, and ecosystem-
level outcomes, achieving a functional understanding of soil microbiomes and plant-microbe
interactions that are important for long-term soil carbon storage.

Simulating nuclear physics with nuclear spin qudits
Dr. Jacob Covey, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Materials Research Laboratory
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Urbana, IL 80101
The Standard Model of particle physics is described by gauge theories in which “gauge bosons” mediate
interactions between matter particles (“fermions”). Simulations of phenomena in the standard model
are performed with lattice gauge theories in which space is discretized to enable efficient computer
simulation. Even so, the simulations quickly become intractable on classical computers, limiting the
ability to predict the spectra and scattering properties of, e.g., nuclear matter. Quantum computers –
based on inherently quantum-mechanical binary digits called “qubits” – show great promise for
simulating the dynamics of lattice gauge theories. However, like classical computers, their binary nature
severely limits their ability to simulate the high-dimensional spaces of quarks and gluons which have
flavor, color, and spin degrees of freedom. Accordingly, quantum hardware that can be operated with
larger quantum digits, generically called “qudits”, instead of qubits provides an opportunity to advance
our understand of lattice gauge theories and their application to nuclear matter, called “quantum
chromodynamics” (QCD). This project will leverage 4- and 8-dimensional spaces of neutral ytterbium-
171 atoms to implement quantum computing algorithms that simulate quantum electrodynamics (QED)
and QCD. This research will utilize an electronic qubit, a nuclear spin qubit, and a motional qubit all
within a single atom where each can be controlled independently. A universal gate set will be
constructed for this multi-qubit encoding and used to realize circuits that simulate electron-positron
scattering and the low-energy spectrum of two-flavor mesons. More broadly, the hardware efficiency of
this approach will carry over to quantum computing and networking applications.

Fine-grained Theory and Robust Algorithms for Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra
Dr. Anil Damle, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14853
Randomized algorithms have gained increased prominence within numerical linear algebra, and they
play a key role in an ever-expanding range of problems driven by a breadth of scientific applications.
Randomized algorithms promise to accelerate pervasive computational kernels (such as low-rank
approximation and solving least squares problems) within scientific computing while simultaneously
providing rigorous theoretical guarantees. Consequently, in the generic case these methods have
received an enormous amount of theoretical analysis, and many strong results have been developed.
However, the matrices that arise from applications are often highly structured and there has been
significantly less analysis of randomized algorithms with respect to such structures.
This project will directly address the development and deployment of randomized algorithms for
problems from domain science. This will include the development of adaptive algorithms that leverage
the best of modern randomized algorithms while retaining certain advantages of classical algorithms.
They will leverage randomization to ensure robustness and computational efficiency, while also
including strategies that adapt to problem structure as they are being run. Complementing these
algorithmic advances, this project will develop a collection of fine-grained theoretical results that refine
our understanding of randomized algorithms. Prior results often obfuscate the nuances of specific
problems, making it difficult for randomized algorithms to effectively exploit the nature of a specific
problem. Newly developed results will explicitly incorporate bounds that adapt to common (application
motivated) structures and provide a more nuanced landscape of theoretical guarantees. Ultimately, this
project will provide a comprehensive picture of the relative performance of randomized and
deterministic methods that enables practitioners to select appropriate algorithms. As a central
motivation for studying randomized algorithms for structured matrices is that they arise in problems of
scientific interest, this project will feature an undercurrent of research objectives in three key domains:
computational physics, data science, and deep learning.

Adaptive multiscale modeling using pseudospectral wavepackets
Scott Dawson, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering
Illinois Institute of Technology
Chicago, IL 60616
This project will develop a suite of methods for the efficient and accurate numerical simulation and
modeling of multiscale, multiphysics systems. Traditional numerical methods often rely on simple
component functions that are largely agnostic to both the underlying physics and the emergent features
of the field variables being solved for. On the other hand, tailored basis functions, while problem-
specific and more accurate, typically require pre-existing high-fidelity data to identify, and can only be
defined numerically on discrete meshes, thereby losing some of the computational advantages of pre-
defined analytic basis functions. This project seeks the best of both worlds: functions to use within
numerical simulation methods that are highly efficient at representing pertinent phenomena without
the need for existing high-fidelity data, while also possessing closed-form analytic descriptions. This
objective will be achieved by leveraging advances in operator pseudospectral theory and projection-
based modeling approaches. This methodology will first be applied to develop nonlinear reduced-order
models that are accurate and adaptive. Next, these methods will be used for closure modeling in the
solution of time-averaged equations. Finally, the methodology will be applied for the high-fidelity
simulation of multiscale systems. The methods will be tested and validated across a range of example
problems, including fluid and thermofluid systems that exhibit turbulence, geometrical complexity, and
fluid-structure interaction.

Multi-Tiered Algorithms for Solving Extreme-Scale Inverse Problems Emerging from New Experiments
Jeffrey Donatelli, Staff Scientist & Group Lead
Mathematics Department
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
Technological advancements at DOE experimental facilities are enabling new measurements of complex
phenomena and specimens with unprecedented detail. However, the ever-increasing extreme scales
involved in analyzing these emerging experiments are surpassing our current ability to solve the inverse
problem of reconstructing important scientific information from the data at the speed, accuracy, and
robustness needed to enable scientific breakthroughs. To fully realize the potential of these state-of-
the-art experiments, advanced high-performance computing systems need to be coupled with
fundamentally new mathematical insights and algorithmic approaches to solve complex inverse
problems at the required scales.
This proposal seeks to develop new mathematical algorithms for solving inverse problems from
experiments at the following emerging extreme scales:
• Data rate. Data is being produced faster than can be loaded into memory or transferred to storage,
requiring large compression, leading to information loss and inaccuracies in inversion. (i)
• Resolution elements. Experiments are making measurements at unprecedented resolution, requiring
unparalleled inversion accuracy to reconstruct. (ii)
• Physical complexity. The complexity of the physics involved in new experiments is skyrocketing,
requiring new methods to efficiently simulate and invert. (iii)
• Problem sensitivity. New experiments are measuring weaker signals, often buried under noise.
Physical limitations can prevent full parameter sampling, leading to inversion ill-conditioning. (iv)
• Turnaround time. Quick results are required to enable real-time steering of experiments and optimal
use of expensive experimental resources. (v)
To address these scales, we propose to develop new multi-tiered inversion frameworks, which are based
on decomposing very complex inverse problems into a series of simpler subproblems, for which optimal
mathematical and algorithmic solutions can be developed to effectively target the specific physics and
scales of the inversion. As demonstrated by the PI’s Multi-Tiered Iterative Projection (M-TIP) technique,
multi-tiered inversion schemes are able to leverage advanced methods in machine learning,
optimization, linear algebra, harmonic analysis, and statistics to solve much more complex inverse
problems than traditional approaches. As a result, M-TIP has allowed us to solve many open problems in
inverting data for emerging DOE experiments at LCLS, APS, ALS, NSLS-II, and NCEM, including enabling
real-time single-particle analysis at LCLS through the ExaFEL ECP.
Here we will leverage and expand upon the M-TIP framework to develop fundamentally new algorithmic
approaches that enable inversion at our targeted scales. This work includes:
Machine-learning-augmented inversion frameworks capable of accurately and efficiently encoding
new physics and constraints (addresses scales ii,iii,iv,v).
Statistically-constrained parameter optimization techniques to automatically determine accurate noise
models and regularization weights during inversion (addresses scales ii,iv,v).
Data-compression modeling in inversion to enable accurate reconstructions from highly compressed
data (addresses scales i,ii,iv,v).
These approaches will be implemented and integrated into M-TIP and our other inversion codes to
enable their immediate use in solving inverse problems from experiments data. By leveraging ASCR
supercomputers, this work will create the computational capability to address emerging practical
barriers in analyzing new extreme-scale experiments, ultimately enabling a host of new scientific
breakthroughs throughout DOE facilities. Finally, our proposed mathematics and algorithms will
establish fundamentally new research pathways in hybrid machine-learning/optimization, optimization-
based automation, data-compression modelling, and algorithmic frameworks that can holistically
combine these advances to tackle a wide range of grand scientific challenges at scale.

Multiscale Modeling of Heteroepitaxial Interfaces for Scalable Thin-Film Solar Cell Applications
Dr. Nelson Dzade, Assistant Professor
Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering
Pennsylvania State University
University Park, PA 16802-0000
Thin-film photovoltaic devices consist of a multilayer architecture, for which charge-carrier transport
across the interfaces plays a crucial role in minimizing the associated recombination losses and achieving
high solar conversion efficiencies. To achieve insight-driven engineering and optimization of thin-film
solar cells, a high-level characterization that gives a local, electronic, and chemical picture of the
interface properties is needed. However, owing to their narrow widths and their often non-crystalline
structures, interfaces are difficult to resolve or access by purely experimental means. Atomistic
modeling and simulation are therefore ideally suited to complement experiments but there is a need for
more efficient multiscale methods, that can operate at larger time and size scales. Two main challenges
of simulating realistic interface models level remain: (i) the simulation cell must be sufficiently large to
accommodate the incommensurate nature of the system and include misfit-induced structural
modifications and (ii) the final structure must not be influenced artificially by the starting structure. With
the emergence of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we are now at the threshold of
achieving efficient atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy.
This project aims to develop and implement a multi-scale modeling environment (integrating advanced
first-principles DFT calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), and classical MD simulations
accelerated by high-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials) to simulate large-scale realistic
interfaces. We will establish a universal set of reliable and transferable MLIPs for large-scale simulated
amorphization and recrystallization molecular dynamics that will evolve the complex microstructural
features observed experimentally at perovskite/charge transport layer interfaces, including interfacial
reconstructions, and defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, vacancies, and interstitials. We will
also establish rational molecular design principles and structure-property relationships needed to
provide experimental guidance for selecting passivation ligands to improve stability and performance.
We will perform a microkinetic simulation of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to predict the
desorption temperatures of selected passivation molecules at perovskite surfaces. The detailed atomic
level information will be experimentally tested and used to enhance the perovskite solar cell technology.
The precise understanding of the microscopic structure of interfaces and the mechanisms of interfacial
phenomena obtained from the work, will not only help to identify specific bottlenecks to the
performance and stability of photovoltaic devices but enable an insight-driven optimization of interface
properties to achieve more efficient and stable solar cells.

Next Generation X-ray Magnetic Measurements at Ultra-High Pressures
Dr. Gilberto Fernandes Lopes Fabbris, Physicist
X-ray Science Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Magnetic interactions are one of the key ingredients towards realizing novel properties in quantum
materials, including several candidates for spintronics, a critical energy relevant technology. Physical
pressure is a well-known route to tune magnetic interactions through the control of interatomic
distances and bond angles. Pressure-driven magnetic quantum phase transitions thus provide a unique
path to driving and understanding novel phenomena not readily accessible at ambient conditions. The
goal of this project is to build a new X-ray Emission Spectroscopy instrument, named MagXES, that
leverages the polarization dependence in x-ray emission to increase the sensitivity of magnetism-
dependent x-ray measurements by as much as two orders of magnitude, enabling high-throughput
measurements of magnetism and electronic properties at extreme pressures. This development will be
complemented with the use of nanofabrication tools to tailor the high-pressure environment, which will
extend the accessible pressure range and enable novel multi-modal electrical transport measurements.
MagXES is designed to take full advantage of the sub-micrometer beam size, advanced x-ray polarization
control, high magnetic field, and low temperature capabilities of the new POLAR beamline at the
upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS). By investigating the correlation between electronic and
magnetic properties in emergent phenomena at high pressure, this research will contribute to the
understanding of novel quantum systems. Beyond the APS, the developed high-pressure methodology
will largely benefit the exploration of quantum materials at extreme conditions.

The goal of this project is to develop an integrated set of innovative X-ray diagnostics that will transform
the current measurements of basic plasma processes and meet the complex and challenging need for
future magnetic fusion energy (MFE) and inertial fusion energy (IFE) experiments including burning
plasmas. There are four thrusts of proposed diagnostic innovations: 1) 1D high resolution X-ray
spectrometers based on novel aspherical crystal shapes for simultaneous achievements of high spatial
and spectral resolutions and high throughput, 2) 2D X-ray imaging system that consists of dual spherical
crystals for stigmatic imaging, 3) radiation-hardened X-ray spectroscopy, and 4) crosscutting connections
between inertial confinement fusion (ICF)/IFE and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF)/MFE. Significant
efforts will be devoted to absolute calibrations of all proposed X-ray diagnostics. With extensive
experiences and ample resources in X-ray diagnostics development, the team is aiming at an innovation
center for developing the next generation of X-ray spectrometers and imagers ready for burning plasmas
and fusion power plants. The proposed X-ray diagnostics, once developed in the laboratory, will be
applied to tackle important physics problems including direct measurements of material mixing for
energy gain enhancement for IFE and active system control at burning plasma conditions for MFE.

Enabling Scientific Data-Driven Modeling from Heterogeneous, Multi-Model, Massive, and
Distributed Datasets
Dr. Gianluca Geraci, Principal Member of Technical Staff
Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification Department
Sandia National Laboratories
Albuquerque, New Mexico
Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) has emerged as a collection of techniques that, by combining data
and numerical methods, can achieve excellent results in learning tasks unsuited or too time intensive for
humans. Unfortunately, while classical ML applications, e.g., speech and object recognition, usually
enjoy an abundance of data, science and engineering problems are often characterized by sparse data.
For scientific predictions, the data sparsity translates to a limited exploration of the high-dimensional
parameter space, which in turn limits the quality and accuracy of the resulting models. In principle, the
data sparsity could be mitigated by leveraging the large amounts of data routinely produced and stored
in scientific laboratories, e.g., U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories; however, these
datasets are generated from different physical experiments or numerical models that span different
experimental configurations and model parameters, i.e., they are heterogeneous. Consequently, these
heterogeneous data cannot be directly employed to augment sparse high-fidelity data.
In this project, we propose to develop domain-aware SciML methods with quantifiable uncertainty that
i) mine multiple modalities of heterogeneous and distributed information available and stored across
enterprises, ii) discover their underlying common representation with high-fidelity data through lower
dimensional parametrizations, and iii) fuse them to enable challenging scientific tasks and predictions.
The project vision is realized by combining multi-model dimension reduction and manifold learning
strategies, multi-model data-fusion approaches for heterogeneous data, and novel uncertainty
quantification workflows to account for epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty generated through the data
reduction, compression, curation, and fusion. Furthermore, we will design SciML methods to operate in
a federated learning fashion such that the transfer of the training datasets across storage locations can
be reduced or significantly minimized. We will demonstrate these novel tools on an array of complex
scientific and engineering problems including, but not limited to, climate, fusion, and wind energy
applications.

A broad exploration of particles and their interactions at the energy frontier is essential for a better
understanding of the fundamental universe. Machine learning (ML) and microelectronics are cross-
cutting technologies that can be leveraged in this exploration to enhance the scientific discovery
potential at collider experiments. This research will employ ML across software and hardware to
improve new physics searches in the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva,
Switzerland. Advanced ML-based anomaly detection (AD) methods will be developed and deployed in
offline data analysis, facilitating model-independent searches for beyond the Standard Model
signatures. In the ATLAS trigger system, online AD will be implemented for the real-time classification of
anomalous collision events, yielding a novel dataset that can be analyzed to probe uncovered regions of
phase space for new physics. Moreover, to enable intelligence at the front-end, ML-based detector
readout will be pursued in the context of embedded Field Programmable Gate Arrays, advancing
microelectronics R&D for future state-of-the-art detector concepts. Results from this research will
inform experimental designs at next-generation energy frontier facilities, such as the Future Circular
Collider proposed to be hosted at CERN with international collaboration. Together these efforts are
expected to provide a new approach for exploring the unknown in particle physics, while simultaneously
developing key interdisciplinary technologies and capabilities.

Understanding the Role of Itinerant Electrons and Inhomogeneity in
Magnetic Van der Waals Materials
Dr. Eduardo Higino da Silva Neto, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Yale University
New Haven, CT 06520
Magnetic materials are essential for various modern technologies. Recently, metallic van der Waals
(vdW) magnets have gained significant attention as they can be easily engineered into thin crystals,
facilitating their integration into devices and switches. Because these materials are also metallic,
itinerant conduction electrons play a pivotal role in mediating magnetic interactions within these
systems. The interplay between metallicity and magnetism enables the electrical control of the magnetic
structure, which is a cornerstone for future spintronic technologies. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms
by which itinerant electrons interact with spins and influence magnetic structures are not yet fully
understood. In many cases, key technological properties like ferromagnetism above room temperature
or electrical control inherently require disorder across different length scales, from the atomic to the
meso-scale. This research project is dedicated to investigating the role of itinerant electrons and
inhomogeneity in prominent magnetic vdW materials. It specifically employs scanning tunneling
microscopy combined with spectroscopy and spin-polarized measurements, to study the spatial
variations of charge, spin and structural properties within metallic vdW materials. Specific goals include
investigating the role of itinerant electrons and inhomogeneity in enhancing ferromagnetic transition
temperatures and in enabling the electric control of local magnetic structures. This research project will
advance our understanding of the fundamental interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom
at the nano- and meso-scales in materials that are expected to play a major role in the development of
controllable quantum systems.

Universality in Quantum Gravity and Beyond
Dr.Luca Iliesiu, Assistant Professor,
Department of Physics,
University of California, Berkeley,
Berkeley, CA 94701
One of the most important open questions about the fundamental laws of our Universe is how to
reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity. Traditionally, the path to answering this question has relied
on finding a unified UV complete theory incorporating all known fundamental forces. Recently, there
has been a tremendous number of developments, from a better understanding of how information
escapes the interior of black holes to exact gravitational path integral computations of BPS black hole
degeneracies, that show that detailed observables in quantum gravity can oftentimes be reliably studied
directly in the low-energy theory without a detailed knowledge of the UV completion. This project will
combine a multitude of interdisciplinary tools, from the abstract tool of supersymmetric localization to
the numerical tool of semidefinite programming, to study universal quantum properties of gravitational
theories and their strongly coupled duals with the hope of addressing some of the most pressing
questions in quantum gravity. Are black holes described by ordinary quantum systems? If so, can we
explain the emergence of a discrete Hilbert space of black hole microstates starting from gravitational
variables? When do gravitational observables receive large quantum corrections, and when can the low
energy theory make quantitative predictions about these corrections? Can the techniques we developed
also be used to study universal features in strongly interacting quantum systems independent of their
relation to holography?

Color Centers in Noise-Free Hosts for Quantum Sensing and Communication Applications
Dr. Alisa Javadi, Assistant Professor
Electrical and Computer Engineering
University of Oklahoma
Norman, Oklahoma, 73019
The advent of quantum technologies heralds the introduction of novel capabilities, such as high-
precision magnetic field sensing and the ability to store and communicate quantum information over
long distances. These technologies leverage quantum emitters to encode quantum information or
monitor environmental changes. Despite their transformative potential, the widespread adoption of
these technologies is impeded by the scarcity of materials in which electron spins exhibit long coherence
times. In the best host materials, magnetic interactions between the nuclei and electron spins induce
fluctuations in electron energy levels, leading to decoherence. While isotopic purification can address
this issue, it remains costly and difficult to scale.
This project explores cerium oxide as a host material for optically active quantum bits. The naturally
abundant isotopes of oxygen and cerium, the two components of cerium oxide, lack magnetic nuclei,
potentially enabling long coherence times without the need for isotopic purification. The large bandgap
of cerium oxide, its compatibility with various substrates, and its biosafety further enhance its suitability
for a broad spectrum of applications. We will employ density functional studies to identify promising
emitters and use pulsed laser deposition to grow high-quality single-crystal films. We aim to synthesize
the predicted emitters in these crystals through doping and ion irradiation and characterize their optical
and spin properties using magneto-optical measurements. The success of this project will uniquely
contribute to the advancement of quantum information science by unlocking a scalable, optically active
qubit platform. Our research on these emitters can yield high-resolution magnetic field sensors capable
of imaging large areas, surpassing the capabilities of existing technology. Additionally, the project will
explore the cooperative phenomena arising from interactions between rare-earth dopants in cerium
oxide, potentially opening new avenues for quantum information storage or the emulation of many-
body effects using these dopants.

Probing Two-Dimensional Quantum Materials with Flying Electron Qubits

Notre Dame, IN 46556
Strongly correlated electronic phases in two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials, such as exfoliated
few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, have attracted enormous attention in recent years. To
understand these materials, innovative probing techniques may reach unexplored regimes and provide
unexpected insights. In this project, we will utilize our recent accomplishment in quantum information
science (QIS) – the long-coherence high-fidelity electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) qubit platform – to
develop a quantum-enabled scanning probe microscopy (SPM). With this technique, 2D quantum
materials under investigation will be transferred onto a superconducting quantum circuit and coated
with a noninvasive layer of solid Ne. A single electron qubit flying above the solid Ne can be transported,
trapped, controlled, and read out by the quantum circuit. The spin states of the qubit electron will
strongly interact with the spin or current states of the material electrons and shed light on the local
magnetic, topological, and superconducting orders approaching zero temperature. The eNe-SPM can
facilitate QIS-inspired material discovery, design, and synthesis and define a new paradigm for quantum
information science in material science and engineering (QIS-MSE).

Learning to Adaptively Manage Heterogeneous Scientific Workloads on Heterogeneous Clusters
Dr. Carlee Joe-Wong, Associate Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA 15213
Computational science applications are growing ever more diverse, driven in part by the growing
prevalence of large-scale machine learning applications that aim to analyze ever-growing amounts of
scientific data. These applications’ computing needs are equally diverse: for example, small-scale
simulations may need only a few CPU cores to complete in a reasonable amount of time, but some
machine learning training tasks my require dozens of the most advanced GPUs. Such diversity raises
significant challenges in ensuring that each application has the computing resources that it needs to
ensure acceptable performance.
Recent work in computer systems proposes to first split applications into constituent tasks and then
provision computing resources for each task, so as to optimize the overall application performance.
Typically, this process is conducted within a (super)computing cluster, so the provisioned computing
resources for an application’s tasks may reside at different, interconnected, and heterogeneous physical
machines. These task placement methods, however, quickly grow infeasible as the number of tasks,
number of applications, and size of the computing cluster grow, especially when applications and
clusters are highly heterogeneous. Working at a large scale, however, may come with a hidden benefit:
large-scale workloads may be broken into more constituent tasks, which may reveal local task
similarities. This project is based on the key insight that even tasks and machines that appear
heterogeneous may exhibit hidden, underlying similarities in their resource requirements and
performance characteristics. The goal of the project is to design, implement, and evaluate new
algorithms to discover and track such hidden similarities, exploiting them to schedule and place
heterogeneous scientific computing workloads in heterogeneous supercomputing clusters. In doing so,
we will be able to develop adaptive and uncertainty-aware placement and scheduling algorithms,
ensuring that scientific computing workloads receive the resources they need in today’s increasingly
large-scale and heterogeneous environments.

Quantum Field Theory in Our Universe
Dr. Austin Joyce, Assistant Professor
Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
University of Chicago
Chicago, IL 60637
Cosmology is a study of correlations. By measuring the correlations between structures in the universe,
like galaxies in the night sky, we determine both the contents of the universe and how it evolved.
Further, by tracing these correlations back in time, we infer that they originated as quantum fluctuations
during a pre-Hot Big Bang epoch of quasi-exponential expansion, which we call cosmic inflation. The
details of this early-universe phase remain deeply mysterious, and we only have access to it via the
correlations that it generated. Understanding the origins of structure in the universe therefore requires
us to understand quantum correlations in cosmological spacetimes. This is the domain of quantum field
theory, and this project will develop new field-theoretic tools to study the universe at its earliest
moments and highest energies.
The goal of this project is to study quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes, like our own, by
focusing directly on the observable correlations that are generated by cosmological time evolution.
These correlations must be consistent with fundamental physics principles, and these consistency
constraints are sufficiently stringent that they can often be used to reconstruct (or “bootstrap”) the
correlations directly. This project will further develop this bootstrap approach to cosmological quantum
field theory by exploring how the physics of time evolution is encoded in cosmological observables, and
by mapping the space of consistent theories in cosmology. These new insights will help refine our
understanding of the dynamics of the universe, and will help make progress on critical questions in
cosmology.

Improved Calibration of Xenon-Based Dark Matter and Neutrino Experiments By Simultaneously
Measuring Different Types of Electron Recoil Backgrounds
Dr. Alvine Kamaha, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
Los Angeles, CA 90095-1547
Background rejection is paramount in the search for the elusive dark matter signal. In the dual-phase
liquid/gas xenon time projection chamber which has emerged as one of the best technologies in direct
detection, these backgrounds mostly arise from electromagnetic (electron and photon) interactions
producing electronic recoils inside the detectors. Their responses, if not properly understood, could
leak into the dark matter nuclear recoil signal region of interest and be mis-identified as dark matter
signals. Our current estimates are that 99.0-99.9% of the background interactions from electrons or
photons can be rejected at 50% nuclear recoil acceptance. However, these estimates were derived from
recoil measurements using a single beta-decay source (producing high energy electrons) with the
assumption that the same response applies for photon interactions. Although some experimental data
and theoretical models suggested that electron recoil responses in liquid xenon are different between
electron and photon interactions, and also vary with the amount of energy deposited and the drift field,
this was not further investigated. As current xenon detectors such as LUX-ZEPLIN are leading the field
and new ones are being planned to probe new parameter spaces drawing us closer to a potential
discovery, every assumption should be tested to avoid a false discovery claim. Moreover, the remaining
electronic-recoil backgrounds from double-beta decay, electron captures, internal conversions, and
Auger electrons should also be properly understood and be accounted for while extracting a potential
dark matter signal. This proposal is about conducting detailed, simultaneous measurements with
small-scale xenon detectors of the liquid xenon responses to all these various electronic recoil
backgrounds at different energies and drift fields. These measurements will then be fed back into the
simulations of the micro-physics of xenon detectors to properly take into account the complete
responses of the detector to these backgrounds to not only improve the sensitivities of current leading
experiment such as LUX-ZEPLIN and future xenon experiments looking for dark matter, but also for
neutrinoless double-beta decay and other rare physics.

Pore-Confinement Effects on Mineral Crystallization Behaviors in Geologic Multiphase Flow Systems
Dr. Shaina Kelly, Assistant Professor
Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering
Columbia University
New York, NY 10027
The objective of this research is to quantify the impact of multiphase flow dynamics, specifically flow
rate and partial water saturation states, on mineral nucleation and crystallization reactions in nano- and
micro-porous geologic media. The project focuses on the formation of carbonate minerals and water-
soluble hydrous minerals within vesicular basalt pore structures and 2D/3D “dual-porosity” microfluidic
analogues. Vesicular basalts are porous igneous rocks that contain tight nano-porous matrices
punctuated by vesicles and/or microfractures of varied connectivity (e.g., dual porosity). Due to their
potential fluid storage capacity, reactivity with carbon dioxide (CO ), and relative global abundance,
2
vesicular basalts are targeted in recent and upcoming government and industrial subsurface carbon
mineralization pilots. Carbon mineralization is a promising long-term CO storage strategy, whereby
2
carbon dioxide is trapped in the form of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate ions and eventually
converted to carbonate minerals through crystallization reactions. The influence of the distribution of
capillary water and water films on supersaturation and subsequent secondary mineral crystallization
morphologies and growth rates in these systems is not yet well understood. The project leverages
subsurface vesicular basalt samples of varied alteration and pore connectivity subjected to natural (i.e.,
long-term) and engineered (i.e., short-term) CO -rich multiphase flow regimes. Multimodal sample
2
imaging and measurement techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), are leveraged to
characterize and create digital representations of pore confinements and alteration states.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are used to quantify the evolution of multiphase flow and
fluid-mineral interactions in those domains. Parallel microfluidic experiments yield fundamental
relationships and controlled CFD benchmarks that isolate multiphase flow controls on short-term
crystallization dynamics. Hydrous minerals (e.g., halite, gypsum, hydrated copper sulfate) are used as
scaled proxies for fast and low-temperature experimental investigation of an extended multiphase flow-
crystallization parameter space. Findings from the research objectives are applicable to enhancing
carbon mineralization in a host of subsurface basaltic and other mafic/ultramafic rocks as well as
subsurface sedimentary formations, soils, mine tailings/heap mines, cements, and packed bed reactors.
The work is also of importance to understanding multiphase flow controls on rock diagenesis,
maintaining flow path connectivity in enhanced geothermal systems, and halite salt precipitation during
carbon storage operations.

Using Crystallographic Defects to Control Emergent Behavior in Quantum Materials
Dr. Itamar Kimchi, Assistant Professor
School of Physics, College of Science
Georgia Institute of Technology
Atlanta, GA 30332
The presence of entanglement in strongly correlated quantum materials underlies their potential for
next-generation technologies with applications ranging from quantum computers to sensors to solid-
state devices. But the same entanglement also poses challenges for theory, prohibiting efficient generic
simulations on classical computers and complicating our classical intuition. A compounding challenge for
correlated quantum theory is set by defects and other types of quenched disorder. These are often
ignored but are always present in real materials. In materials such as alloys and doped compounds,
disorder is intrinsic, and its properties are in part controllable. This offers a tuning handle. Here we pose
the question: Can disorder in correlated quantum materials be useful for identifying, generating, and
controlling desirable emergent behavior?
In this project we address this question by constructing original theoretical models that allow us to
describe novel behavior. Our approach combines a diverse theoretical toolbox ranging from analytical
quantum field theory techniques to diagonalization and tensor network numerics. We supplement this
toolbox with collaborations with experimentalists to disseminate and apply the developed abstract
theories and to identify and resolve experimental puzzles in current and next generation compounds. A
longstanding puzzle involves the highly entangled Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) phases of strongly
correlated magnetic insulators. QSLs offer a combination of exciting emergent features (codes for robust
quantum computing, gauge photons, anyons) together with relative theoretical control and
experimental realizability, making QSLs the ideal platform for investigating entanglement-driven
emergence. But QSL materials are inherently difficult to identify due to their fluctuating (“liquid”) spins.
This is made even more challenging by crystallographic defects since both, clean QSLs and trivial
disordered systems, typically show broadly featureless spectra.
To address these issues, we pursue three objectives: (1) Demonstrate the creation of a certain QSL from
weak disorder and construct a full theory, with important implications for controlling emergent behavior
using defects, and for quantum information processing. (2) Construct a theory for predicting a class of
defect effects in QSLs, which may enable disordered QSLs to be experimentally identified and
manipulated. (3) Construct theories that address the dichotomy between global and local experimental
probes in materials with local defects, with implications for their design and interpretation with
disorder.
Understanding disorder in strongly correlated quantum materials is an important and urgent task for
developing next generation technologies for energy applications. This project constructs original
theoretical frameworks that address this task. The outcome of this research is to guide new theoretical
concepts and experimental probes to uncover how crystallographic defects can identify, generate, and
control emergent quantum behavior.

Wasted Space?: Visualizing Rare Earth Element Ligand and Analyte Access within Porous Materials
Dr. Lydia Kisley, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics

Cleveland, OH 44106-1712
Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical components for green technologies that must be separated from
complex mixtures such as naturally mineralized mined ores or recycled sources before use. Current
approaches to extract REEs use harsh solvents resulting in a high carbon footprint and environmental
cost. Biological- and bio-inspired molecules on solid supports are a promising alternative to selectively
separate REEs. Biomolecules offer the tunability of Nature’s toolbox. Just as well-known biological
membrane proteins can select between sodium, potassium, and calcium, natural proteins have evolved
to selectively adsorb REE ions. Yet, protein-based REE separations on solid supports have thus far been
studied using ensemble techniques that are unable to directly probe molecular phenomena at surfaces,
resulting in top down, trial-and-error optimization. In order to transform REE separation science from
the bottom up, variations in the physical molecular dynamics that occur under realistic separation
pressure conditions are measured using single-REE-ion microscopy. Binding events of interest include
interactions between REE ions to high affinity, larger protein ligands and to smaller, engineerable, lower
affinity peptide ligands immobilized in porous materials. Lanmodulin and peptide ligand size are varied
to evaluate how the interior of porous materials is under-utilized in separations based on the steric
differences between the ligand and material pores. Molecular information will therefore inform the
design and development of new, more efficient REE separations to extract these critical elements to
support the clean energy infrastructure.

Realizing Functionality in Graphene-Based Quantum Materials
via Addressing their Atomic-Scale Properties
Dr. Marek Kolmer, Scientist II
Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering
Ames National Laboratory
Ames, IA 50011
New digital and quantum information processing strategies based on modifying existing physical
paradigms represent key research directions dictating the main vectors of progress in modern
condensed matter physics. These are motivated mainly by (1) overcoming the physical limits in
developing existing CMOS technologies, and (2) novel emerging applications mainly related to quantum
computing. In this respect, low-dimensional solid-state systems attract much attention, as recent
scientific developments in their synthesis in hierarchical heterostructures enable realizing quantum-
mechanical-originating effects such as dissipationless transport in topologically protected edge states.
Precise and rational synthesis of quantum materials realizes the emergent properties that derive from
controlling their exact atomic-level architectures. On the other hand, the functionality that results from
such atomic-scale control of quantum materials requires similar precision in developing local addressing
tools for its practical realization. In this case, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)-based techniques are
the first methods for atomically precise mapping of local topography and distribution of electronic or
spin density of states. However, a knowledge gap exists between the characterization of given
nanosystems and testing their expected functional properties, even in prototypical applications. As a
result, a common problem exists: how to understand the relation between the local signatures of the
emerging quantum properties, e.g., in the density of states from the STM experiment, and the
mesoscale quantum behavior, e.g., in electronic transport?
The program addresses this issue and proposes a rational approach to understanding functionality in
low-dimensional graphene-based quantum materials. We will combine atomically precise on-surface
synthesis strategies and in-situ advanced scanning probe microscopy-based methods to reveal the
origins of their mesoscale characteristics. These complementary activities are based on our unique
expertise in (1) atomically precise synthesis of graphene-based quantum materials, i.e., on substrates
providing electronic decoupling, and (2) developing STM-based techniques, including atomically precise
multi-probe scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.

Nuclear and Chemical Sciences Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550
The impact of experimental data on our understanding of nuclear processes is gauged only to the extent
that such data can be meaningfully compared to theoretical predictions. Since a significant portion of
nuclear data comes from nuclear reaction experiments it is imperative that a predictive reaction theory
with quantified uncertainties is formulated, to fully take advantage of high-precision measurements. The
goal of this proposal is to combine a first-principle theory of nuclear reactions with verified statistical
methods to arrive at a predictive modeling of nuclear reactions with quantified uncertainties. Such a
theory will provide stringent constraints and realistic covariances for difficult-to-measure nuclear
reaction observables. At the same time, this research will demonstrate how elusive emergent
phenomena connect to the fundamental nuclear interaction. Finally, by combining available
experimental data with theoretical predictions across reaction networks, this work will produce
evaluations for astrophysically-relevant reaction cross sections, as well as observables related to nuclear
clustering. Thus, this work will provide a first ever evaluation of thermonuclear reactions at the network
level that originates in an uncertainty-quantified microscopic reaction theory.

Machine Learning-Enabled Monitoring of Metallic Solutes via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy in
Molten Salt Fusion Blankets
Dr. Stephen Lam, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical Engineering, Francis College of Engineering
University of Massachusetts Lowell
Lowell, MA 01854
Recent advances in high-temperature superconductors enable compact, high-field fusion systems that
can be deployed in a timely manner for achieving commercial fusion. Here, molten salts are a promising
class of fusion blankets that can breed and recover tritium to sustain deuterium-tritium fusion reaction,
shield magnets against radiation, and efficiently transfer large amounts of heat to cool the first wall.
However, utilizing molten salts in a fusion energy system remains a grand challenge owing to their
continuously evolving potential to corrode structural metals, precipitate metallic foulants, and emit
volatile metal halides during operation. As such, online monitoring and control of salt chemistry and
metal dissolution is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of a fusion power plant. The objectives of
this project are to address these needs by 1) developing new tools for monitoring the oxidation states
and structures of molten salts with unprecedented spatial resolution, 2) learning the extended structural
morphologies and distributions of solvated species that will be found in prototypical fusion systems, and
3) learning the relationships between solute-salt structure and reduction potential. New approaches are
proposed that combine recent advances and push the boundaries of machine learning-assisted atomistic
simulation, deep learning-based spectral analysis, and high-throughput laboratory-based X-ray
absorption spectroscopy, to maximize online measurement efficiency and information recovery.
Methods will be validated using synchrotron experiments, and a clear understanding of solvation
structures leading to corrosion and precipitation will be developed for structural metals and reducing
agents in fusion salts for the first time. As such, this work will help resolve long-standing challenges that
have impeded real-time understanding of chemical transformations in molten salts and enable their use
in future fusion energy technologies.

Incorporating Kinetic Effects in Fluid Models of Low Temperature Plasmas via Machine Learning
Dr. Amanda Lietz, Assistant Professor
Department of Nuclear Engineering
North Carolina State University
Raleigh, NC 27607
Computational modeling of low temperature plasmas (LTPs) is critical for many technology areas
including manufacturing of computer chips, medical treatments, and the synthesis of nanomaterials. For
LTPs, particle-in-cell (PIC) Monte Carlo collision simulations is the highest-fidelity technique commonly
used. In these models, electrons and ions are treated kinetically – meaning there are no assumptions
about their velocity distributions. However, even the massively parallel kinetic codes rarely reach the
time scales, length scales, and dimensionality of most real problems. As a result, many of these
problems have been examined using fluid models with approximations (e.g., Maxwellian distributions,
drift-diffusion fluxes, local mean energy approximation). This project aims to develop and evaluate
methods to use machine learning to bridge the gap between kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and fluid-
based models for LTPs. These new techniques will enable simulations that extend to fluid time and
length scales but include physics that are normally only present in kinetic simulations. This approach will
reduce computational time by several orders of magnitude compared to purely kinetic simulations. The
method will be applied to explore kinetic effects in atmospheric pressure streamer propagation, a
problem in which the high collision frequency makes kinetic simulations computationally prohibitive.
These methods would transform computational modeling of LTPs more broadly, enabling an improved
understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry that is critical for chemical conversion,
semiconductor processing, plasma medicine, and many other areas.

Reveal the Structure-Dynamics Relationship in Solution-Phase Photoredox Catalysis with
Explainable Machine Learning
Dr. Fang Liu, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Emory University
Atlanta, GA 30322
Bimolecular photoinduced electron transfer in the solution phase is fundamental for energy science
applications, such as photovoltaics, artificial photosynthesis, and photoredox catalysis. Understanding
how the chemical structures of electron donors and acceptors impact the photoinduced electron
transfer dynamics is crucial for improving photoredox catalysis efficiency. However, traditional theories
for bimolecular electron transfer do not explicitly account for essential structural parameters like the
mutual orientation of donor and acceptor molecules. Consequently, there are no established guidelines
for designing photoredox catalysts to enhance charge transfer efficiency in specific reactions. This
project exploits a data-driven approach to reveal the structure-dynamics relationship in solution-phase
photoredox catalysis, using a photopolymerization reaction as the model system. This objective can be
achieved by implementing an automated data pipeline for molecular dynamics simulations of
photoinduced electron transfer between a fixed electron donor and various photoredox catalyst
candidates in explicit solvent environments. Explainable machine learning models can then extract the
structure-dynamics relationships from the simulation data, addressing fundamental questions about
how catalyst structures dictate donor-catalyst orientation/separation and how these factors influence
charge transfer and catalytic efficiency. This project promises transformative discoveries in the field of
photoredox catalysis, enabling energy-efficient and eco-conscious chemical reactions. The strong
connection to DOE-operated high-performance computing facilities will further enhance the impact of
advanced computing on complex condensed-phase and interfacial molecular science.

Narrowing the Human-AI Knowledge Gap through Audience-Aware Visualization
Dr. Shusen Liu, Research Scientist
Machine Intelligence Group, Center for Applied Computing, Computation Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly deep neural network models, to
tackle critical scientific problems has exposed a growing knowledge disparity between machines and
humans. Machine knowledge is encoded in network parameters and latent representations, which are
inaccessible to users. In contrast, human knowledge is expressed through natural language, high-level
concepts, and logical reasoning, making it difficult to communicate effectively with machines when
solving scientific problems. This machine-user knowledge gap raises crucial questions: (1) how can users
interpret and extract knowledge from machines to gain scientific insights, and (2) how can users
effectively convey their intentions and understanding to machines for model steering and
improvements?
Objective: Bridging machine learning (ML) and visualization research, this project will create an adaptive
and audience-aware visualization framework that supports machine-human knowledge exchanges. The
established framework will reveal the model's internal logic, inject user knowledge back into the model,
and address the differences in users' knowledge levels and their distinct goals.
Method: To achieve this vision of effective human-AI knowledge exchange, I propose three
interconnected research directions: (1) Extract knowledge from models to inform diverse audiences: I
will develop adaptive visualization approaches that adjust to the needs of different audience groups
(e.g., ML researchers, domain scientists, policymakers/public) by providing insights about the AI models
at varying levels of complexity; (2) Inject user knowledge and convey intention to models: I will
maximize the efficiency of human feedback to machines by developing methods to generalize user
annotations to the machine, and I will develop a framework to translate user intentions expressed in
natural language into composable instructions to machines; and (3) Identify the shared abstraction
between machine and human: I will explore techniques to map out the shared semantic abstractions
that will be understandable for human users yet accessible and controllable in the ML pipeline. This
abstraction will form a universal backbone for human-AI knowledge exchange and democratize access
to complex black-box ML systems and enable researchers from diverse backgrounds to contribute to
interpretability and alignment research.
Impact: This proposal addresses fundamental challenges in developing intelligent approaches for
adaptive, context-aware visualization of scientific data and AI, as well as science communication, both of
which are priority research directions (PRDs) identified by ASCR in the basic research needs report for
visualization for scientific discovery, decision-making, and communication. By developing novel
techniques that combine ML with intuitive and interactive visualizations, I will provide domain experts
with the tools and insights necessary to understand, interpret, and align AI models with their domain
knowledge to facilitate discovery. Through close integration with Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory projects, I will demonstrate immediate benefits for ML applications in material science,
physics, and biology. With a forward-looking research agenda, the proposed research will also yield
long-term impacts in AI-driven discovery, scientific foundation models, and AI safety.

Neutron Scattering Studies of Nanoscopic Structure and Dynamics of
Single Ion Conducting Polymer Blend Electrolytes
Dr. Whitney Loo, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Madison, WI 53706
The ongoing development of rechargeable batteries with increased energy density is critical to continue
the growth in the electrification of mobile technologies. To achieve these goals, new electrolytes must
be developed that possess fast ion transport characterized by high ionic conductivity and high cation
transference number (the fraction of ions that carry current), a combination of properties typically not
found in a single material. Therefore, we propose a novel battery electrolyte system known as single ion
conducting polymer blend electrolytes (SIPBEs), which are binary mixtures of an ion-containing polymer
and an ion-conducting polymer. The ion-containing polymer contains Li+ counter ions that induce mixing
with the ion-conducting polymer generating robust miscible blends. Although it is well-known that ion
transport in polymer electrolytes is intrinsically linked to the polymer self-assembly and segmental
dynamics, the ion transport mechanism in multicomponent polymer systems remains an open question.
We will use neutron scattering to study the nanoscopic structure and dynamics of a SIPBE model system.
Through selective isotopic labeling, neutron scattering is the only technique capable of probing the
static and dynamic behavior of each polymer component individually with nanoscopic resolution.
Fundamental insights generated from this work will develop a novel class of Li metal battery electrolytes
accompanied by a theoretical framework to describe the thermodynamics and ion transport mechanism
of the multicomponent polymer system. While we will focus on a single model system, the insights
gained from the developed theoretical model can be applied broadly to guide material design of
optimized battery electrolytes for various battery chemistries including “Beyond Li” chemistries (i.e.,
sodium, magnesium batteries).

Development of a Novel High Count Rate, High Resolution Neutron Camera with
Advanced Gamma Discrimination Capabilities
Dr. Matthew Loyd, Detector Scientist
Neutron Technologies Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
Neutrons are powerful nondestructive probes of the structure and dynamics of materials. They play a
unique role in developing new materials due to the unique nature and features of neutrons, enabling
insight into materials no other probe can. New materials are much needed to provide technology-
enabling properties, including polymers, pharmaceuticals, biological membranes, batteries, solar cells,
novel superconductors, and magnets.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) hosts two of the most powerful neutron sources in the world, the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). These world-class neutron
sources currently support over 30 neutron scattering instruments designed for specific experiments that
require tailored and sometimes unique neutron detector configurations. Detecting thermal and cold
neutrons is challenging because of their low kinetic energy, low absorption cross-sections for most
materials, and lack of charge. As neutron sources become more powerful, and next-generation neutron
techniques more sensitive, current neutron detector technology is being pushed past fundamental limits
of count rate, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. The objective of this project is to develop a
general-purpose neutron detector, suited to a wide range of scattering instruments, to meet these
future requirements.
This detector will be based on current Anger camera technologies that use a scintillator layer to convert
low-energy thermal neutrons into thousands of visible photons along with an array of silicon
photomultipliers to localize the neutron absorption position. Improvements in both the neutron-
converting layer (scintillator) and read-out electronics will allow seamless, unlimited tiling for building a
modular detector array of sizes from tens to thousands of square centimeters. Hardware, firmware
(programable logic), and software will be designed to allow for simultaneous neutron detection at
separate locations on the detector as well as maximum count rates greater than 1 million per second.
The ability to reject gamma radiation, which is unavoidably produced during neutron scattering
experiments, is crucial for observing extremely weak but scientifically important signatures for many
experiments. Gamma discrimination will be advanced via hardware-implemented pulse analysis and by
using a novel, ORNL-developed multilayer scintillator that relies on the differences in electron and ion
energy deposition to reduce the signal from gamma radiation.

Ultrafast Spin Torque Dynamics in van der Waals Magnetic Heterostructures
Dr. Yunqiu Kelly Luo, Gabilan Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
University of Southern California
Los Angeles, CA 90089
This research program aims to achieve space-time visualization and manipulation of nonequilibrium
spin, charge, and magnetic orderings using Sagnac interferometry and ultrafast time-resolved Kerr
rotation optical microscopies, along with the Quantum Spin-Polarized Low-Energy Electron Microscope,
at femtosecond temporal and nanoscale spatial resolutions. The PI and her collaborators will pioneer
the development and adaptation of these advanced optical and electron microscopies to demonstrate
the excitation and manipulation of nonequilibrium spin and charge orderings in van der Waals magnetic
heterostructures driven by electrically-generated spin current and spin transfer torque. The
fundamental knowledge established in this program will uncover emergent frontiers of modern
condensed matter physics, such as Berry curvature of unoccupied states, topological phases, and long-
range chiral spin orderings.
The research effort is organized under two themes. The first theme will be primarily conducted in the
PI’s lab to investigate space-time correlation of topological spin-torque dynamics in 2D magnets using
advanced optical probes. The second theme will be carried out in collaboration with the Quantum Spin-
Polarized Low-Energy Electron Microscope (qSPLEEM) user facility at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab
Molecular Foundry, with the goal of visualizing nonequilibrium and nonuniform spin and charge
orderings in van der Waals magnetic heterostructures.
The fundamental understanding of coupling and dynamics of various quantum degrees of freedom
(spins, photons, magnons) at van der Waals interfaces and heterostructures provides a solid scientific
foundation that will guide the choice of materials and the design of devices incorporating future spin-
based quantum computing and quantum sensing hardware. The success of this proposed program will
potentially address some of the most urgent needs for the microelectronic industry, particularly by
enabling new forms of energy efficient nonvolatile magnetic memory, low-power computing, high-
performance terahertz emitters, and multifunctional hybrid quantum devices with widespread societal
impact.

Toward an Enhanced Photon Detection System for DUNE Far Detector 3
Dr. David Martinez Caicedo, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
South Dakota School of Mines and Technology
Rapid City, SD 57701
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) aims to study neutrino oscillations, explore
phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics, and provide clues to explain why the
universe does not have equal amounts of matter and antimatter. The photon detection system (PDS) of
the DUNE far detector contains components that must operate in challenging, high-voltage
environments at cryogenic temperatures. To address these challenges, power-over-fiber (PoF)
technology has emerged as a reliable solution. The PoF technology produces electrical power by sending
light, typically from a pig-tailed laser diode, through an optical fiber connected to a photovoltaic power
converter. South Dakota School of Mines & Technology and Fermilab led the first application of PoF
technology in high energy physics, successfully powering DUNE Far Detector 2 PDS prototypes that were
located on a high-voltage cathode surface and submerged in liquid argon. This research project aims to
enhance the PoF technology through collaboration with Fermilab and industry experts to develop
customized solutions that optimize PoF components for harsh conditions. The improved technology will
power the novel field-cage-integrated large-area photon detectors proposed for DUNE Far Detector 3.
Expanding photon detection coverage will improve energy thresholds, time resolution, and energy
resolution, enhancing sensitivities to supernova and solar neutrinos, as well as searches for phenomena
beyond the standard model. Additionally, the analysis of charged-particle test-beam data that will be
collected with DUNE prototypes located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) will
improve the understanding of hadron-argon interactions and develop better techniques for particle
identification. The results of this project could guide future directions for using PoF technology in other
systems operating in challenging environments, such as dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay
experiments. Moreover, the results of the project could benefit quantum and space-exploration
technologies by offering a dependable solution with low noise, optimal efficiency and superior isolation.

Late-Time Observations of Type Ia Supernovae to Probe Nucleosynthesis in Thermonuclear Explosions
Adam A Miller, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
Northwestern University
Evanston, IL 60208
Stars born with an initial mass approximately eight times or less than that of the Sun will evolve into a
white dwarf (WD) star. Some WDs in binary star systems can experience thermonuclear runaway in their
cores producing an explosion that fully disrupts and ejects the stellar material, known as a Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia). Explosive nucleosynthesis in SNe Ia produces the majority of the iron-group elements
(IGEs; e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt) in the Universe. While we know that WDs can explode, precise
knowledge of the mechanism that ignites the explosion and the WD binary systems that can be
disrupted via thermonuclear runaway eludes us. In the next year, two new experiments that scan the
night sky searching for stellar explosions, the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4) and the Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will each begin. For this DoE Early Career
award, we will leverage the incredible synergistic possibilities of LS4 and LSST and connect these two
experiments to produce a novel, holistic view of SNe Ia that captures their evolution from just after
explosion for multiple years after their thermonuclear ignition. We will build a new machine learning
model that uses artificial intelligence to automatically discover stellar explosions in newly acquired LS4
images. Following that, we will couple the observations from LS4 and LSST to constrain which WD
systems explode and subsequently conduct three independent probes of explosive nucleosynthesis in
SNe Ia, based on early, late, and ultra-late observations of thermonuclear SNe. The novel coupling of a
small and large telescope will produce an unprecedented “experiment” that synergistically fuses two
separate surveys to execute these disparate lines of inquiry producing the largest systematic study of
nucleosynthesis in thermonuclear explosions that has ever been conducted.

Exploring Actinide Nanocrystal Growth towards Defining 5f Surface Chemistry
Dr. Liane M. Moreau, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Washington State University
Pullman, WA 99164
When particles are very small, down to the nanometer length scale, they display unusual properties not
typical of larger materials. Most of the atoms in these structures are at the surface of the particles,
which give them different electronic properties. While these unusual properties have been studied in
most of the periodic table, little is known about how the electronic properties of the actinides, such as
neptunium and plutonium, behave when they become so small. This planned research will study growth
pathways of actinide nanoscale particles. Interestingly, the shapes of the particles change depending on
the specific actinide species, spanning from thorium through americium, despite having otherwise
identical arrangements of atoms. This project will use differences in the shapes and growth pathways of
different actinide particles to learn about trends in electronic properties at surfaces across the actinide
row. Growth pathways will be determined using a combination of synthesis and the use of advanced X-
ray characterization tools. These X-ray characterization tools can provide information about electronic
properties and also local bonding characteristics. This project will also inform how to make
unprecedented actinide oxide nanoparticles using very small quantities of material. This will enable safe
working with radioactive materials and the study of materials that never before have been made into
nanoparticles. Meanwhile, students will be trained in working with these exotic materials.

Time-Dependent Electronic Structure Theory of Atomic Qubits:
Entanglement, Coherence, and Dynamical Response
Dr. Martín A. Mosquera, Assistant Professor

Montana State University
Bozeman, MT 59717
Neutral-atom quantum computers (NAQCs) are promising platforms for unlocking advanced quantum
computation in analog mode. This transformative innovation could solve significant scientific challenges
beyond the reach of conventional classical computing. Achieving this with NAQCs requires a
comprehensive physical and quantitative understanding of two-dimensional atomic clusters, the
building blocks of these quantum computers. Progress in this direction is essential for enhancing the
creation and control of quantum coherences, as well as for the design and operation of groundbreaking
NAQCs. However, a crucial unsolved problem is accurately predicting the time evolution of atomic
qubits under arbitrary initial states and understanding how this evolution is influenced by driving laser
fields and sources of noise. Addressing these points, this project aims to: (1) Advance new cutting-edge
theoretical methods for predicting the dynamical response of general quantum states, such as
entangled, superimposed, and excited states of NAQC building blocks; (2) Develop highly parallelizable
open-source algorithms to numerically describe the time evolution of these atomic clusters under
general initial states, laser pulses, and different geometrical settings; and (3) Discover strategies for
generating, characterizing, and controlling coherent/entangled states. Additionally, the effect of physical
sources of error/noise on the time behavior of atom clusters will be investigated, including ways to
mitigate or control them. This work will result in the deployment of flexible, scalable, publicly accessible
software to support the critical development of analog quantum computing systems aimed at surpassing
the capabilities of conventional classical technologies.

Advancing the Lorentzian Frontier: From Collider Physics to Novel Structures in QFT
Dr. Ian Moult, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Yale University
New Haven, Connecticut 06511
The most powerful means of understanding nature at the smallest length scales is with particle colliders.
Colliders smash together particles at the highest possible energies, briefly producing new particles
through quantum fluctuations, and ultimately leading to complicated sprays of energy in the
surrounding detectors. Improving our understanding of the underlying microscopic physics of the
Standard Model, and furthering the search for subtle quantum imprints of new physics, therefore relies
on our ability to decode these complicated correlations in energy flow.
In quantum field theory, energy flux in collider physics experiments is described by correlation functions
of energy flow operators. These operators have recently been found to play a central role in diverse
areas of formal quantum field theory and gravity, with applications ranging from non-perturbative
constraints on renormalization group flows, to understanding the emergence of causality in the Anti-de
Sitter Space / Conformal Field Theory correspondence.
The goal of this research program is to explore both formal aspects, and phenomenological applications,
of energy flow operators, and to build bridges between developments in formal quantum field theory
and collider phenomenology. The research program will develop new theoretical tools to enable world
record precision measurements of parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, will enhance
searches for new physics at colliders, and will uncover novel theoretical structures in quantum field
theory and gravity.

Topological Classification of Chemical Reactions:
A New Tool to Understand and Manipulate Chemical Reactivity
Dr. Lukas Muechler, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Department of Physics
Penn State University
University Park, PA 16802-7000
We will develop a fundamentally new approach for exploring the quantum mechanical principles of
molecules and their reactions by leveraging recent developments in the field of topological physics. This
approach has the potential to change the way chemical reactions are understood and manipulated by
providing novel tools and concepts for examining the global properties of the potential energy surface
using topological methods. The project will focus on three aims: 1) Systematically establishing the use of
modern topological concepts such as invariants for molecules; 2) Studying the relationship between
changes in topological invariants and reaction dynamics; and 3) Applying the new theory to a model
system: cyclization reactions described by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, to find systematic ways to
switch between allowed and forbidden pathways.
The application of topology, a branch of mathematics, to the study of electronic energy bands in
crystalline materials has had a revolutionary impact on the field of condensed matter physics; it led to
the discovery of new quantum states such as topological insulators and semimetals and was recognized
with the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the context of topological band theory, topological invariants
serve as order parameters for crossings between electronic energy levels. These crossings, whether
manifesting as isolated points, lines, or surfaces, cause the occurrence of topological surface states.
Electrons in these states are protected from scattering, making topological materials attractive for use in
the next generation of electronic devices as scattering can limit device performance. Current estimates
suggest that approximately 53% of existing crystalline materials might harbor topologically protected
electronic states, a statistic that underscores the widespread potential of topological analysis in
materials science.
The application of modern topological methods to molecular systems has been largely unexplored, since
insights from band theory do not easily translate due to the distinct quantum mechanical descriptions of
solids and molecules. Understanding the global properties of the potential energy surface (PES),
including the location and connectivity of crossings and avoided crossings, is crucial for developing tools
to selectively influence the outcome of chemical reactions. We will bridge this gap by providing new
tools to predict and manipulate the outcome of chemical reactions through classifying the global
properties of the PES with topological methods. We will focus on experimentally verifiable predictions
that will provide the chemical community with a set of theoretical tools for tackling the challenges of
chemical synthesis. A long-term outcome of a successful effort will be new tools to predict and
manipulate the outcome of chemical reactions by classifying the global properties of the potential
energy surface, e.g. crossing points, seams and higher order saddle points through topological methods.
The ability to greatly improve cycle-fatigue of electrocyclization based photoswitches would provide a
new framework to drive new innovations in chemical synthesis.

Enzyme-like Porous Catalysts for Upgrading Biomass Feedstocks
Dr. Andy Nguyen, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Illinois, Chicago
Chicago, IL 606067
Biomass is the largest source of renewable carbon, and the ability to refine it into valuable products
could significantly reduce petroleum usage. Unfortunately, significant quantities of biomass are wasted
because current catalysts struggle to efficiently transform these complex chemicals, like lignin and
polyols, into desirable value-added commodities. Enzymes can accomplish many of these challenging
reactions in large part due to their multifunctional active sites, but they are fragile and costly. Our
objective is to integrate key features of enzymes into solid-state materials to achieve durable,
recyclable, and highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for tackling biomass conversion. However, the
design and synthesis of artificial materials that approach the complexity of enzymes is a long-standing
challenge. This project leverages recently discovered peptide frameworks, which are porous solid-state
materials spontaneously generated from peptide self-assembly. Like enzyme active sites, the pores
within these materials have multiple unique functional groups that are permutable, enabling rapid
synthesis of elaborate catalyst variants. This project will evolve these scaffolds to enhance the
sustainability and efficiency of catalytic processes for aerobic lignin valorization and polyol
deoxygenation. Furthermore, the crystallinity of these peptide frameworks provides a unique
opportunity to routinely obtain high-resolution structural data that informs the rational design of next-
generation catalysts. The expected outcomes of this research are more efficient catalysts for upgrading
biomass, versatile tools to precisely manipulate multiple noncovalent interactions, and fundamental
structure-activity knowledge for enzyme-like catalyst design.

Precision Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy for direct neutrino mass measurements
Elise Novitski, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Washington, Seattle WA 98195
Neutrinos are the most common particles of known matter. They played a crucial role in shaping the
formation of structure in the early universe. Today, they are emitted in huge numbers by the fusion
reactions that power the sun. Our fundamental theories predicted that they would be massless, but
experiments have shown that they do have a tiny mass: less than one millionth that of electrons! They
are so light that no one has yet succeeded in measuring their mass, only in setting an upper limit. We
also don't understand the physics that gives rise to neutrino mass; it may be connected to yet-to-be-
discovered, extremely heavy particles, or even to the mechanism that caused there to be more matter
than antimatter in the universe, enabling our existence. Knowing the mass of neutrinos would improve
our understanding of both fundamental physics and of the origins of our universe.
The research funded by this Early Career Award will advance an emerging technique, Cyclotron
Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), to pave the way to measuring the neutrino mass. To learn
about neutrino mass, we observe the radioactive decay of tritium, which produces an electron and an
anti-neutrino (which has the same mass as a regular-matter neutrino). We cannot detect the neutrinos
directly, but by precisely measuring the energy of the electrons that are produced, we can deduce how
much energy from the decay is going into creating the neutrino mass, following E=mc2. With the CRES
technique, rather than measuring the electrons' energies by letting them slam into a solid detector as in
previous detection techniques, we use an antenna to pick up the extremely faint radio waves that each
single electron produces as it moves in a magnetic field. The frequency of these radio waves tells us the
electron's energy, a link caused by Einstein’s special relativity.
Recently, with the Project 8 Collaboration, we published the first neutrino-mass measurement using
CRES. It demonstrated CRES's excellent energy precision and powerful background-noise suppression.
To become sensitive to even smaller neutrino masses, we must make the experimental apparatus larger
to observe more decays, and we must also measure electron energies more precisely than ever before.
Using a new resonant-cavity-based detector that is compatible with this scaling-up, we will measure the
energies of electrons emitted by 83mKr internal-conversion decay with a goal of reaching 0.3 eV
resolution, more than three times better precision than in our previous work. We will also improve
precision by developing magnetometry, energy-calibration, and analysis techniques to make use of
signal features to reconstruct, and correct for, the tiny differences in the magnetic fields experienced by
individual electrons. These improvements will play a crucial role in making it possible to reach our
targeted sensitivity to ten-times-lower neutrino mass than the limit set by current experiments. This will
yield insight into how the universe became what it is today.

Modeling the Molecular Mechanisms of Interfacial Welding in Self-Healing Polymers
Dr. Thomas C. O’Connor, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA 15217
Intrinsically self-healing polymers are plastics that rapidly repair damage when two broken interfaces
are brought into contact. Self-healing plastics have garnered interest as sustainable plastic alternatives
because they can be repaired and reused, reducing the accumulation of plastic waste. However,
designing self-healing plastics remains challenging because the molecular mechanisms governing self-
healing remain poorly understood in many polymer systems. We lack this knowledge because self-
healing occurs at nanoscale polymer interfaces, and experiments cannot easily access these details while
interfaces are welding together. The objective of our project is to combine molecular dynamics
simulations and mechanical welding experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate
self-healing in polymers with precisely controlled chemical sequences. Molecular simulations can
directly resolve the molecular-scale details of polymer interfaces and relate them to the time-dependent
recovery of mechanical strength measured in experiments. This combined approach will build
fundamental relationships relating the chemical structure of polymer chains to the speed at which they
recover specific mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, and yield stress during interfacial welding.
Our findings will guide the molecular design and synthesis of new self-healing plastics with improved
durability and repairability.

Understanding fluid flow through complex fracture networks is essential to advance energy systems
such as hydraulic fracturing, enhanced geothermal systems, carbon sequestration, and hydrogen
storage. Traditional numerical methods struggle to model these networks because of the wide range of
fracture sizes and their complex interconnections. This research utilizes machine learning and quantum
computing to address these challenges. By training advanced machine learning models, the project will
create fast, accurate simulations of reactive transport processes across multiple scales, significantly
reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy. Quantum computing will be employed to
explore the potential of solving large systems of fracture flow equations that are currently intractable
with classical computers, providing insights into the role of small-scale fractures that are neglected in
classical simulations. Quantum algorithms for seismic wave propagation will also be studied, aiming to
enhance interpretation of seismic data and improve models of subsurface dynamics. While quantum
computing holds promise, this work aims to estimate the quantum resources required and optimize
algorithms to make them practical for application to fractured systems in the coming years. This
research aligns with the mission to develop advanced computational methods for subsurface energy
applications, supporting the clean energy transition.

Searching for Strongly Coupled Dark Matter at the LHC with Unsupervised and Generative AI
Dr. Kevin Pedro, Associate Scientist
Computational Science and Artificial Intelligence Directorate
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
The nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding questions in particle physics. New
models of strongly coupled hidden sectors akin to standard model (SM) quantum chromodynamics
(QCD), called “dark QCD”, predict invisible, composite dark matter candidates that are only accessible at
colliders. These models are associated with several novel phenomena, notably semivisible jets, which
contain a mixture of visible particles and invisible dark matter. Data acquired from the third physics run
of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Switzerland provide an unparalleled opportunity to execute a model-independent strategy motivated by
the complexity of dark QCD. At the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, unsupervised artificial
intelligence (AI) will be employed to record interesting or “anomalous” events at the trigger level, as
well as to reject SM background jets. Semi-supervised, interpretable AI will reconstruct the mass of the
dark matter particles from the semivisible jets, providing an observable signature independent of how
the dark sector couples to the SM. Once this search is complete, combinations of semivisible jets and
other dark QCD phenomena will be scanned to identify models that have not yet been covered in order
to motivate future CMS searches at the high-luminosity LHC. Exploring this broad model space requires
large simulated event samples, which are prohibitive to produce with the current software. Diffusion
models, a leading generative AI technique, will be trained to replace and enhance detector simulation,
providing competitive quality while substantially reducing computation. The algorithm inference will be
accelerated on graphics processing unit (GPU) coprocessors, such as those at high performance
computing (HPC) centers, accessed as a service to maximize portability, flexibility, and throughput, while
minimizing cost. The outcomes from this research are expected to have theoretical impact and practical
relevance throughout the field of particle physics while simultaneously advancing feasibility and design
studies for future colliders.

Co-designed Quantum Many-Body Suite for Deciphering Quantum Phenomena
in Complex Molecular Systems
Dr. Bo Peng, Computational Scientist
Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
Complex molecular systems, particularly the quantum phenomena they exhibit, present significant
challenges due to limitations in integrating current theories, computational methods, and the
experimental observations. The core scientific challenge is to accurately model quantum exchanges of
charge, spin, and energy, which are crucial across various disciplines. Examples include understanding
how molecules with specific structures can transport quantum states, how water shows unique
quantum behaviors over time, and how molecules interact with light and vibrations at the quantum
level. Gaining insight into these systems-level behaviors and emergent functionalities will facilitate the
manipulation of information and energy transport in a wide range of fields such as catalysis and
quantum information science.
Towards this goal, this project will develop an innovative and comprehensive quantum many-body suite.
This suite aims to overcome the challenge of simulating system-level behaviors with precise control over
accuracy, ensuring computational efficiency and sustainability. The project will leverage our experience
developing computational chemistry capabilities at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the
synergy among advanced theories in quantum chemistry, physics, and mathematics alongside state-of-
the-art computing technologies and leading-edge experimental methods. This integrated approach will
enable more detailed study of specific complex molecular systems in detail.

Exclusive Reactions at the EIC with Far-Forward Superconducting Nanowire Detectors

Superconducting nanowire detectors, known for their exceptional speed and precision, are widely used
in quantum information science and nanophotonics to count individual photons at high rates with
minimal noise. However, their use in other fields, such as nuclear physics, is rare and not yet fully
exploited. This research aims to adapt this quantum technology into a fully functional charged particle
detector for the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory capable. This
research project will develop superconducting nanowire sensor arrays and integrated cryogenic
electronics components, to detect and identify particles in the harsh environment of the accelerator
where the detection is very close to the high intensity circulating beams far from the collision point.
Successfully creating this technology will significantly enhance the nuclear physics research program at
accelerator facilities and contribute valuable knowledge to the field of quantum sensors by
understanding how they operate under a variety of conditions, including high magnetic field
environments.

Investigating the Fundamental Properties of the Heaviest Elements
Dr. Jennifer Louise Pore, Research Scientist
Nuclear Science Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
The Periodic Table of Elements (PTE), one of science’s biggest celebrities, might need revisions. It is well-
recognized, even by elementary students, that the PTE elegantly organizes the elements by their
chemical properties. But what if the chart adorning classroom walls is wrong? The Superheavy Elements
(SHEs, Z > 103) were added to the PTE by increasing proton number at the bottom of the d-block. Yet,
the suggested "signature" d-electron configurations and associated chemical behaviors indicated by
these placements may be significantly different from the true properties of these elements due to the
onset of relativistic effects. In the past, studying the chemical properties of SHEs has been tough - they
don’t exist naturally on Earth and need to be created one atom at a time in nuclear physics labs. They
are also highly radioactive with short lifespans, making their properties hard to pin down. This research
program aims to re-evaluate the placements of these elusive elements by probing the accessibility and
reactivity of each element’s signature d-electron configuration. The first step will be to examine the
accessibility of the d1 and d2 electron configurations of Lr (Z = 103) and Rf (Z = 104), respectively. It has
been shown, in systematic gas-phase studies of elements more accessible than SHEs, that metal ions
with ground state or low-lying d1 or d2 electron configurations would form distinct molecular products if
reacted with alkane gases such as methane, ethane, etc. To perform similar studies on SHEs, a new
experimental technique has been developed at Berkeley Lab utilizing the Berkeley Gas-Filled Separator
and FIONA devices. This technique allows for the direct assessment of SHE ion reactivity using atom-at-
a-time gas-phase measurements. Now, SHE ions can be contained within an ion trap while reactive
gases are added, enabling chemical reactions to occur. The resulting species are then directly identified
by their mass-to-charge ratio. Observing the specific molecular species produced from these reactions
with alkane gases will reveal the true d-character of these heavy elements and help determine their
correct positions on the PTE.

Investigating the interactive impact of long-term warming and altered precipitation on grassland
nitrifying communities
Dr. Wei Qin, Assistant Professor
School of Biological Sciences
Institute for Environmental Genomics
University of Oklahoma
Norman, OK 73019
Nitrogen is a major limiting nutrient for living organisms in many natural and agricultural ecosystems.
Soil microorganisms play critical roles in the global nitrogen cycle. Microorganisms such as archaea and
bacteria that are able to oxidize ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate, are called nitrifiers. These
microorganisms control the inventory and transformation of reactive nitrogen species in soils. Nitrifiers
also contribute to nitrogen losses by producing the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and as nitrate
moves from the soil into groundwater. Understanding how environmental and climatic variables control
nitrifier abundance and activity is essential for achieving a sustainable bioenergy economy and
maintaining healthy soil ecosystems amidst rapid climate change. Leveraging a long-term experimental
field simulation system established in 2009 at a US Great Plains tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma, this
research combines fieldwork and laboratory studies to investigate the interactive effects of climate
warming and altered precipitation on the diversity, structure, and activities of soil nitrifiers, the
nitrification process, and the associated nitrous oxide production. Using an integrated approach that
includes culture-based ecophysiological characterizations, multi-omics technologies, stable isotope
probing, and high-throughput droplet microfluidics, this project aims to elucidate the physiological,
molecular, and ecological mechanisms controlling the responses of soil nitrifiers to climate change. This
work will expand our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on microorganisms
involved in the nitrogen cycle and the corresponding microbial feedback to soil biogeochemistry,
nutrient dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Understanding and Controlling Light and Spin Dynamics in Chiral Hybrid Semiconductors
Dr. Lina Quan, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg, VA 24061
Semiconductor spintronics aims to advance the evolution of next generation low-power electronics,
information processing, communication, and storage. In order for spintronic devices to fulfill the
demands for high-speed, high-density, and low-power electronic components, innovations in materials
design and processes are essential. The spin generation and manipulation in GaAs is feasible due to a
strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), however, the spin lifetime is relatively short. Whereas in graphene and
diamond with weak SOC, longer spin lifetimes are observed. Materials possessing both strong SOC and
prolonged spin lifetimes represent an ideal yet rare category for spintronic applications, offering an
exciting prospect for the development of unconventional semiconductors. To fill this gap, this project
will be subdivided into two tasks: (1) advancing new organic-inorganic chiral semiconductors with
tailored chiroptical properties, and (2) subsequently obtaining optical control and manipulation of spin
dynamics without the need for an external magnetic field through ultrafast spectroscopy
measurements. Achieving the objectives of this project requires a strong synergy between materials
design and synthesis using a solution-processable approach and advanced characterization of optical
and spin dynamics in the materials. This accomplishment will enable the control and characterization of
chiral semiconductors, providing guidelines for designing superior solution-processable spintronic
materials.

Searching for New Physics with Real-time Anomaly Detection
Dr. Dylan Rankin, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
University of Pennsylvania
Philadelphia, PA 19104
An extremely vast array of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) have been performed
during the lifetime of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland. Although certain tantalizing hints exist, BSM physics remains
elusive. As a result, it is becoming increasingly necessary to question the typical paradigms and methods
used in new physics searches at the LHC. Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
techniques, specifically those under the umbrella of “anomaly detection” (AD), are now capable of
enabling searches that do not rely on assumptions about the nature of BSM physics. Such AD techniques
are especially necessary in cases where the form that BSM physics may take does not agree with existing
theoretical models and where current strategies are highly unlikely to produce a future discovery. The
prospects for a discovery with traditional analysis methods are even weaker in scenarios where BSM
physics occupies a region of phase space that is not selected by existing experimental trigger methods.
In this case, a new observation will not occur through larger datasets or more advanced data analysis,
but instead only through improved triggering capabilities. The integration of real-time AD into the ATLAS
(A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector’s trigger at the LHC will be combined with sophisticated AD-based
search methods that are designed in conjunction with those used in the trigger. The comprehensive
application of AD at all stages of data collection and analysis will maximize the potential for scientific
discoveries and provide sensitivity to new physics that would otherwise go entirely undetected at the
LHC. Moreover, this research will make extensive use of recent advances in the deployment of AI/ML on
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to improve the efficacy of the complex ATLAS trigger
framework as well as facilitate broader improvements in AI/ML that can enhance subsequent data
analysis capabilities. The techniques and tools developed for real-time AD are also expected to have
profound implications for on-detector data compression at both current and future particle physics
experiments.

Chemical and Loading Rate Controls on Fracture: Toward a Universal ‘Phase-Diagram’ of
Factors Controlling Fracture Networks from Creep to Dynamic Failure
Dr. Alex J. Rinehart, Associate Professor
Earth and Environmental Science Department
New Mexico Tech
Socorro, NM 87801
A boulder slowly falling apart in the desert, stimulation of bedrock in geothermal wells, and an asteroid
impact – all of these are examples of fracture in rocks, but the rate of fracturing or cracking goes across
twelve orders of magnitude (<10-8 m/s to >103 m/s). If these were lengths, this range of magnitudes is
the difference of a size of less than the head of a pin (1 mm) vs. the distance to the moon (4 trillion mm).
Despite how common fractures are and their broad use in engineered systems, no systematic
experimental study or theoretical framework exists for the full range of deformation rates, or detailed
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the fracture-scale observations. This research
fills that gap. Across the full range of fracture rates, the project combines physical experiments that
control the factors that drive fracture (chemical reactions vs. mechanically pulling the material apart),
and simulations of the processes at the molecular scale. Ultimately, the experiments and simulations
will be used to test a concept that could unite the full range of deformation together into a unified
framework.
Fractures form when a narrow tip is levered open – the tip concentrates stress, providing a preferred
location for the material to rupture. At high rates, the molecular bonds holding the rock together are
being mechanically torn apart. At the highest rates, the fracture propagates near the speed of sound –
the limit of rate of fracture propagation – and excess energy is used up either fracturing the rock away
from the main fracture or in ‘tearing’ liquids like water off the fracture surfaces. At the lowest rates, the
stretching of molecular bonds at the crack tip allows water to more easily break bonds at the tip – this is
a process called stress corrosion. Intermediate (quasistatic) rates lead to single fracture planes.
Complicating the picture above, if the crack tip is repeatedly stressed, or fatigued, then small flaws will
randomly add up around the fracture tip and in the rest of the material, forming a volume that is
damaged which allows fractures to move forward.
This study fractures silicate rocks across the full spectrum of deformation rates, exploring the impact of
different types and sizes of flaws, chemical reaction rates, and surface tension on the energy required to
break the material. The study places fracturing processes into a unified framework independent of rate
by quantifying how different factors dissipate energy during fracturing, either away from the crack tip or
in the crack tip. This is analogous to using a prybar to break apart pieces of particle board vs. pieces of
hickory. The study proposes that rocks don’t care about the process and rate that breaks them, just the
efficiency of being broken.

Chiral Dynamics in Asymmetric Catalysts Probed by X-rays
Dr. Jérémy R. Rouxel, Assistant Physicist
Chemical Sciences and Engineering
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439-4801
Chirality, or the lack of inversion symmetry, is very common in nature and is found on all scales, from
the shape of galaxies to certain properties of subatomic particles. It is crucial across a broad array of
open questions in chemistry, including both fundamental problems and applied challenges. In this
program, we will develop new X-ray spectroscopy techniques to explore chirality as it occurs in
molecules. These techniques will provide a qualitatively new type of element-sensitive local information
that will help scientists understand the structure and evolution of chirality at the atomic level.
Specifically, we aim to understand the process of asymmetric catalysis, in which chirality is transferred
from a chiral molecule to an achiral one.
Current techniques can detect whether a molecule is chiral but are less successful at detecting where
and how chirality is induced. To access that mechanistic information, we will develop chirality-sensitive
ultrafast X-ray spectroscopies. These have become feasible due to recent improvements at large-scale
X-ray light sources, that now provide adequate energy, brightness, time resolution, stability, and
polarization control. We will carry out experiments both on simple, well-known chiral molecules and on
chiral transition-metal catalysts. These experiments will be complemented by theoretical and modeling
work.

Scalable Additive Manufacturing of Spherical Foam Targets for Inertial Fusion Energy
Dr. Sourabh K. Saha, Assistant Professor
George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering
Georgia Institute of Technology
Atlanta, GA 30332
Nuclear fusion promises clean, reliable, safe, and abundant energy with minimal radiation risks. The
2022 fusion ignition demonstration at the National Ignition Facility marked a critical milestone toward
achieving the goal of producing net energy via inertial fusion. However, major scientific and
technological barriers remain in making inertial fusion energy (IFE) an economically viable source of
electricity. One of the biggest hurdles is the cost and production rate of the spherical fuel containers,
which are known as targets. For fusion to be economically competitive, targets must be produced at a
fraction of the current cost and at much higher speeds. At present, target manufacturing is slow and
expensive due to the need for extreme precision. This project aims to transform IFE target
manufacturing from a low-volume, expensive effort into a cost-effective, mass-production enterprise.
This will be achieved by generating the processing science for a scalable additive manufacturing (AM)
approach for producing foam targets using the two-photon polymerization (2PP) technique. This
technique uses light to process material with nanoscale precision. Although 2PP can achieve the
extreme precision needed for IFE targets, it currently suffers from uncontrolled defects and low
production rates. These challenges will be overcome by studying and eliminating defects, increasing
production rates, and reducing costs through novel light projection techniques. By transforming 2PP into
a fast layer-by-layer process and developing models to predict the processing outcomes, this project
seeks to create a scalable, affordable, and ultra-precise IFE target manufacturing approach. The resulting
manufacturing capability will enable novel experimental and computational physics studies of target
yield performance with advanced foam-based target designs. Furthermore, the manufacturing science
knowledge generated in this work will pave the way for commercially viable fusion energy by enabling
the industrial-scale production of IFE targets.

Hydrodynamics as a Platform to Harness Emergent Properties of Quantum Materials
Dr. Thomas Scaffidi, Assistant Professor
Physics and Astronomy Department
University of California, Irvine
Irvine, CA 92697
Transport measurements are incredibly sensitive tools for examining the emerging low-energy, long-
wavelength features of quantum materials. Unfortunately, very few methods exist to calculate transport
properties in strongly correlated materials without making unjustified assumptions about quasiparticles
and their scattering. In this context, the formalism of hydrodynamics stands out as a non-perturbative
method which works even better in the presence of strong interactions. In this project, we develop new
theoretical formalism to (1) find new materials exhibiting hydrodynamic transport and predict smoking-
gun signatures of this regime, (2) surpass the limitations of semiclassical calculations by exploiting
connections with the growth of operator complexity in quantum systems, and (3) explore unique
features of hydrodynamic transport by exploiting non-linear, topological, and geometrical effects.
In the first thrust, we use numerical methods to calculate the electron-electron scattering operator for
realistic band structures obtained from first principles, and use it to make quantitative predictions about
experiments which are sensitive probes of the hierarchy of relaxation timescales in correlated metals,
namely (1) ultrasound attenuation, (2) the angle-dependent magnetoresistance, (3) the temperature
scaling of the resistivity, and (4) non-linear transport as a probe of Berry curvature multipoles. In the
second thrust, we use the connection between Krylov operator growth and quantum transport to derive
general properties of transport in correlated materials which depend only on universal features of the
Krylov description of quantum dynamics. In the third trust, we develop a combination of theoretical
tools (from the Navier-Stokes equation to lattice Boltzmann simulations) to study how the interplay
between non-linear, topological, and geometrical effects contributes to the emergence of novel
phenomena in hydrodynamic metals.
The research program will advance the field of viscous electronics which has shown promise for
applications in low-energy electronics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics. It will also produce new tools to
predict transport properties of quantum materials, including a detailed understanding of the hierarchy
of relaxation time scales in correlated metals. The research program will be complemented by an
educational mission centered around student mentorship and training, with a special emphasis on
fostering greater involvement of underrepresented minorities in physics.

Atomistic Information Theory of Materials Synthesis and Free Energy Landscapes
Dr. Daniel Schwalbe-Koda, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
University of California, Los Angeles
Los Angeles, CA 90095-1595
Atomic-scale control of synthesis can enable the production of materials with structures and properties
unachievable by conventional routes. While determining which structures should be synthesized is now
a mature task within computational science, predicting how to synthesize them is challenging with
computational methods, particularly at the atomistic scale. This project will develop a theoretical
framework to obtain and control free energy pathways relevant for materials synthesis. By building on
recent advances in machine learning potentials, high-throughput simulations, synthesis prediction, and
statistical thermodynamics, this work will: (1) propose an atomistic information theory to simplify
calculations of free energies landscapes; (2) rationalize crystallization and precursor selection in
inorganic synthesis using information as a surrogate for free energies; (3) compute kinetic phase
diagrams to inform advanced manufacturing approaches; and (4) elucidate mechanisms of synthesis for
seed-assisted crystallization of inorganic materials, interfaces, and amorphous systems. Complementing
property prediction methods or materials design pipelines, this project proposes a first-principles
approach to synthesis simulation by focusing on large-scale quantification of entropy and its surrogate
metrics. Along with atomistic simulations, the work will deliver a computational counterpart to in situ
characterization methods for synthesis and theoretical models that rationalize processing conditions for
transformative manufacturing.

Reducing the core-edge integration gaps in tokamaks with novel divertor geometries and plasma
configurations
Dr. Filippo Scotti, Research Scientist

This project will provide two-dimensional quantitative divertor detachment characterization for a range
of existing and proposed DIII-D divertor geometries, targeting core-edge integration issues in tokamaks
via new diagnostics, experimental analysis, and simulations on the DIII-D National Fusion Facility. One of
the main challenges faced by magnetic fusion energy devices is the integration of a high-performance
core with a divertor plasma compatible with the survival of the divertor and first wall materials. Future
reactors will rely on impurity seeding to achieve divertor detachment and reduce steady state and
transient heat fluxes onto plasma-facing components. The DIII-D National Fusion Facility is pursuing an
upgrade plan to test new divertors for improved detachment front stability, develop new plasma scenarios
based on negative triangularity shaping, and change the wall materials to reduce the extrapolation gap to
future fusion power plants. Enabled by new spectroscopic capabilities—together with the existing suite of
unique DIII-D divertor diagnostics and the anticipated divertor upgrades—this research program will
address core edge integration questions essential for future devices, derive empirical detachment scalings,
experimentally verify capabilities of the new divertor/wall upgrades to optimize the divertor radiation
front while avoiding transient re-attachment and act to validate boundary codes in divertor regimes closer
to those expected in a reactor. This research will develop new fast 2D ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and
ultraviolet spectroscopic imaging diagnostics for determining seeded impurity densities and radiation
dynamics and steady-state and time-dependent simulation capabilities benchmarked on the DIII-D
tokamak that will aid in the extrapolation towards a tokamak-based fusion power plant.

Dynamically Switching Polymer Networks using Transmutable Nanoparticles as Crosslinks
Dr. S. Eileen Seo, Assistant Professor
Chemical Engineering, School for Engineering of Matter, Transport, and Energy
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ 85281-2001
Bio-inspired, self-repairing properties for polymeric materials prolong the lifetime of materials against
physical damage. The translation of such fundamental biological principles to materials systems is
important for advancing the versatility and energy efficiency of modern materials. This research will
apply interfacial engineering and self-assembly strategies to synthesize a multi-component polymeric
material that displays reversible mechanical adaptability. We will achieve this goal through the judicious
design of transmutable nanoparticles as polymer crosslinks that can reversibly control the interfacial
nanoscale bond dynamics and network topology at junctions. Positive cooperativity via multivalent
interactions enhances the bond strength of underlying weak monovalent interactions in polymer
networks, but it also slows down the bond exchange kinetics and self-repairing efficiency. Our strategy
will mitigate this effect by manipulating the extent of positive cooperativity by controlling the number
and type of interfacial interactions using an external stimulus and providing a synthetic route to reach
two (or more) distinct equilibrium states. Overcoming this key drawback of self-repairing polymers using
nanotechnology will enable the design of sustainable materials for a wide range of applications relevant
to energy technologies, including bio-inspired mechanics, photoactuators, and advanced packaging, and,
more broadly, the basic science underpinning the role of nanoscale bond dynamics in multi-component
polymer networks.

Light-Driven Proximity Control of Designer Moiré Nanomaterials
Dr. Kyle Seyler, Assistant Professor
Optical Sciences
The University of Arizona
Tucson, AZ 85721
Exposing quantum materials to intense electromagnetic stimulation can induce novel emergent
phenomena that are unattainable in thermodynamic equilibrium. In recent years, extensive
experimental work has aimed to discover new quantum phases driven by ultrafast laser pulses, which
can enhance our knowledge of quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium and enrich the
possibilities for next-generation quantum technologies. However, we lack a systematic understanding of
how nonequilibrium quantum phases emerge, what forms they can take, and how to control them. A
promising approach to bridge this knowledge gap and foster new technological developments is to
integrate ultrafast control techniques with nanomaterial systems that possess flat electronic bands,
since they possess rich quantum phases, high sensitivity to small perturbations, and versatile equilibrium
control knobs that can unlock new territory for nonequilibrium exploration.
This project will develop and deploy novel ultrafast driving protocols to realize nonequilibrium electronic
and magnetic phases in two-dimensional (2D) moiré nanomaterials. Femtosecond laser excitation can
generate rapid light-induced effects in different 2D materials, including charge/spin dynamics and phase
transitions. Our strategy is to use tailored laser pulses to photo-excite 2D materials in proximity to a
moiré bilayer, which can quickly modify the moiré parameters in a non-local fashion. Specifically, we will
harness interlayer charge transfer, photo-induced insulator-to-metal transitions, and ultrafast
magnetization dynamics to generate rapid doping, screening changes, and magnetic exchange field
control in a target moiré material. These three ultrafast “proximity pumping” protocols will be combined
with traditional photodoping control and equilibrium moiré tuning knobs, such as electrostatic doping
and electric field, to systematically investigate the response of 2D moiré magnetism and correlated
insulating states far from equilibrium. This research will address fundamental questions about moiré
quantum materials, enable new functionalities for quantum optoelectronics, and establish a strategy for
precisely tailoring light and matter to create, understand, and control nonequilibrium phases.

UNSHADE: Understanding and Modeling of Shallow to Deep Convection Transition
Dr. Sara Shamekh, Assistant Professor
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
New York University
New York City, NY 10012
Moist convection, a key component in cloud formation, precipitation, and energy transport, is critical to
understanding and modeling weather and climate. Moist convection undergoes several stages, evolving
from shallow clouds to deep precipitating convection. The shallow to deep convection transition is
subject to considerable variability, influenced by factors such as atmospheric thermodynamics, large-
scale flows, land-atmosphere interactions, and the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer. Climate
models frequently struggle with accurately capturing shallow to deep convection transition, often
hastening the transition phase and triggering deep convection prematurely, sometimes hours earlier
than observations. Such premature activation contributes to significant inaccuracies in the timing and
intensity of convective processes. This, in turn, misrepresents the diurnal cycle of precipitation and the
cloud radiative effects, leading to substantial biases in the hydrological cycle and the Earth’s energy
budget as predicted by these models.
Accurately modeling the shallow to deep convection transition requires understanding the complex
interplay of multiple factors, such as the atmospheric thermodynamic state and updraft characteristics,
including their width and turbulent kinetic energy. The non-linear nature of these interactions
complicates both the quantification of individual contributions and the development of accurate models
that depict the evolution of convection. This project addresses these challenges by using observational
data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility at the Bankhead National
Forest (AMF3-BNF). We will employ advanced machine learning techniques to preprocess this data and
develop models that quantify the factors contributing to the shallow to deep convection transition. The
AMF3-BNF site is ideal for this research due to its comprehensive monitoring capabilities of the land
surface, planetary boundary layer, and lower free troposphere.
The UNSHADE project aims to clarify the role of various factors in the convection transition using
modern machine learning methods. By incorporating these insights into climate models, the project
aims to refine predictions of the diurnal cycle of moist convection, improving the accuracy of
hydrological cycle and Earth’s energy budget forecasts. Additionally, UNSHADE will develop machine
learning-based tools for data preprocessing, which will be integrated into the ARM data system to
enhance research on land-atmosphere interactions, planetary boundary layer dynamics, and deep
convection.

Mind the Gap: Direct Probing Room Temperature Topological Spin Textures with
Multi-modal Electron Microscopy
Dr. Yu-Tsun Shao, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science
University of Southern California
Los Angeles, CA 90089
Topological spin textures such as skyrmions are particle-like objects consisting of swirling spins that have
the potential to revolutionize information and related technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) van der
Waals (vdW) magnetic materials offer a unique platform for exploring novel magnetic and topological
phases, owing to their highly tunable crystal symmetries and magnetic interactions within and across
the vdW gap. Room temperature stabilization of topological spin textures opens opportunities for
spintronics applications based on atomically thin vdW crystals. This research project will develop
innovative techniques based on four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)
to directly measure the spin and lattice structures and understand the interplay between real-space
topology, crystal symmetry breaking, and magnetism. Specifically, the goal is to investigate how the
topological spin textures beyond skyrmion are stabilized at room temperature through intercalated
magnetic atoms within the vdW gap. Furthermore, this research will manipulate emergent spin textures
and elucidate the mechanisms of their transformation, using in-situ 4D-STEM with electrical and
temperature measurements within nanodevices. The findings are expected to provide a foundational
understanding of the underlying physics that governs these complex materials, thereby enabling the
design and manipulation of quantum materials for future technological applications.

Spin Dynamics of Molecular Qubits
Dr. Philip Shushkov, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Indiana University
Bloomington, IN 47405
Molecules with unpaired electrons can serve as the building blocks of the next-generation artificial
systems for quantum information processing. Such molecular qubits have a well-defined molecular
structure, which can be tuned with remarkable precision. Molecular qubits employ the electronic spin,
an intrinsic quantum property of the electron, to encode quantum information. However, interactions of
the electronic spin with molecular vibrations disrupt the coherent motion of the spin, destroying the
stored quantum information. Molecular qubits are thus a fruitful playground to address fundamental
questions on the loss of quantum coherence as a result of the interactions of quantum systems with
their environment. By developing and applying theoretical and computational methods, this research
aims to derive a comprehensive first-principles microscopic model of the decoherence processes that
destroy the electronic spin coherence in molecules. The model will include both traditional spin-
vibrational interactions, resulting from the vibrational modulation of static spin interactions, and novel
spin-vibrational interactions, resulting from the finite-velocity atomic motion, like the spin-vibrational
orbit coupling. Using the first-principles model, this research will uncover how molecular composition,
geometry, electronic structure, and vibrational motion work together to determine the spin coherence
of molecular spin systems. The new theoretical methods will be employed to directly simulate the spin
dynamics of structurally diverse molecular qubit candidates, charting the road to enhanced electronic
spin coherence at elevated temperatures in early-transition-metal molecular qubits. The theoretical
approaches will also be applied to understand spin coherence in optically controlled electronic spin
qubits, which employ the interaction of molecules with light to manipulate the electronic spin, and to
describe the spin dynamics of molecular qubits in complex chemical systems. Beyond enabling the
structural tunability of the coherent properties of molecular spin systems, this research will define
strategies to create and manipulate quantum states for quantum information processing of molecular
coherent systems in diverse chemical environments and in a wide temperature range.

Application of Additive Manufacturing to Target Fabrication
Dr. Jennifer Shusterman, Staff Scientist
Nuclear and Chemical Sciences Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
Innovation in target fabrication approaches is needed for isotope production to meet increased
demands for radionuclides and evolution of accelerator facilities that will have higher intensity beams.
In most cases of isotope production, full dissolution of the target is not desirable as it slows down the
radiochemical isolation of the product, can decrease the specific activity, and at times, introduce
complex or hazardous chemical processes for hard-to-dissolve metals. Additive manufacturing (AM)
allows for careful tuning of the composition and geometry of a final component through feedstock
design and particle consolidation approach. Specifically, the ability to tune the composition will be
leveraged in this work by creating custom multi-element feedstocks to avoid full target dissolution. The
approach will apply four objectives to three radionuclide production test cases: 1) synthesize and
characterize feedstock, 2) deposit feedstock on the substrate and characterize, 3) irradiate samples, and
4) isolate and characterize product radionuclides. This work will directly address the need for novel
methods for isotope production with innovation in target fabrication using additive manufacturing.
Successful demonstration of new target production approaches will benefit the isotope production
community as well as the specific fields that use these isotopes including nuclear medicine, forensics,
physics, and more.

Radiation Transport in Laser-produced Extreme Ultraviolet Plasma Light Sources
Dr. Marien Simeni Simeni, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering
University of Minnesota
Minneapolis, MN 55455
Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a key enabler of the ongoing technology transition from a
microelectronic to a nanoelectronic semiconductor industry. Such transition is needed to sustain
Moore’s law and continue to shrink transistor characteristic feature size. EUVL light sources use laser-
produced plasmas on tin targets, where molten tin droplets are ablated by a pulsed CO2 laser to
generate plasma that emits intense light at 13.5 nm (92 eV). The sole global supplier (ASML Holding)
produces EUVL machines that have enabled the current 5-nm process node era in semiconductor
manufacturing. However, chip makers are seeking higher throughput (about 200 exposed wafers per
hour) which requires a power output of 600 W at 13.5 nm that is beyond the current capabilities of the
commercial machines. The low conversion efficiency (CE) of laser pulse to EUV radiation, presently at 3-
6%, is a significant limiting factor. To achieve the theoretical maximum CE of 20%, replacing CO2 lasers
with Nd:YAG lasers is being explored. Nd:YAG lasers offer better wall-plug efficiency, compactness, and
advanced pulse shaping capabilities, which could potentially increase CE. However, plasmas produced by
Nd:YAG lasers have higher densities, making them opaque to EUV radiation and requiring the transport
of EUV radiation from high-density to low-density regions, thereby reducing CE. While theoretical
models suggest mechanisms for this radiation transport, experimental validation is lacking. This project
aims to leverage ultrafast optical diagnostics, such as collective Thomson scattering, optical emission
spectroscopy, and x-ray betatron imaging, to study opacity and radiation transport during laser-tin
target interactions. This research will validate fundamental scaling laws and pave the way for future light
sources at even shorter wavelengths (~6.7 nm, Blue-X technology), which are expected to use targets
such as gadolinium instead of tin.

Role of Energy in Continuous Dielectrophoretic Molecular Separations
Dr. Craig Snoeyink, Assistant Professor
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
University of Buffalo
Amherst, NY 14260
This project is developing predictive models for dielectrophoretic separations. Dielectrophoresis is a
type of force whereby charged and non-charged species undergo separation in the presence of a non-
uniform electric field. Current models that explain these separations do not align with experimental
observations by up to two orders of magnitude. To reconcile this discrepancy, a new model that
incorporates properties of the solution is being developed. Key to this is acquiring and correlating local
solution property data and field strength using a continuum model. Four objectives are sought. First, the
continuum model of dielectrophoretic transport is being validated for colloidal particle solutions.
Second, the validity of this model is being extended to the molecular scale. Next, an understanding
between separations throughput and efficiency is sought so that the final objective, which focuses on
understanding and quantifying the sensitivity of dielectrophoretic separations by observing several
challenging separations such as the rare earth series and chiral solutions, is achieved. The completion of
these objectives is enabled by a unique experimental approach that permits real time, spatially resolved
spectroscopy measurements of solution composition between and around electrodes while controlling
initial concentrations, field strengths and gradients, and flow rates. In so doing, advancements in and
expansion of this non-thermal separation mechanism are likely.

Synthesis and Structure-Property Relationships in the New Family of
Porous Metal Halide Semiconductors (PMHS)
Dr. Ioannis Spanopoulos, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of South Florida
Tampa, FL 33617-2008
Semiconductor materials are the core components of almost every electronic device currently utilized
for terrestrial and space applications. With the advancement of technology, there is a demand for next-
generation materials that feature multiple functionalities besides excellent optoelectronic properties. In
particular, the generation of porosity in fully inorganic semiconductors not only improved their
optoelectronic features, enabled bandgap tuning, and enhanced photoconductivity but also rendered
them proper for uncharted applications, such as photocatalysis and energy storage. Motivated by these
synthetic challenges, we recently developed a new family of materials, namely porous metal halide
semiconductors (PMHS). Utilization of molecular cages as structure-directing agents and counter-cations
rendered PMHS porous and water-stable for over 1.5 years without impacting their optoelectronic
properties. While this stability performance is unparalleled for hybrid semiconductors, the reasons
behind it remain unclear. Interestingly, the fact that these compounds can indeed be rendered porous
opens new avenues in material design, as, in addition to the currently available customization of
optoelectronic and mechanical properties, it is now possible to fine-tune the porosity. Therefore, this
project’s focus is to expand the pallet of PMHS materials, allowing a deeper dive into the understanding
of the structural factors that dictate stability and how porosity impacts their optoelectronic and ionic
properties. The development of PMHS materials will address current hybrid semiconductors’
deficiencies towards commercialization, fostering a competitive and sustainable economy.
Corresponding PMHS can be tailored to target applications such as lithium-free solid-state batteries,
water purification, and disinfection, water-stable antibacterial coatings on personal protective
equipment and medical devices, CO reduction, and hydrogen evolution (HER) reaction for the
2
generation of clean fuels.

Modulation of Light-Harvesting by Endogenous Switches and Fuses in the Phycobilisomes
Dr. Allison H. Squires, Neubauer Family Assistant Professor
Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering
The University of Chicago
Chicago, IL 60637
From solar cell design to engineered crops to biofuel production, human technologies for harvesting and
harnessing solar energy are inevitably inspired by (or co-opt) the elegant, diverse photosynthetic
systems found in nature. Like naturally evolved systems, our technologies must operate in ever-
changing sunlight and environmental conditions, which can result in photodamage or reduced
efficiency. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria have all evolved sophisticated ways to protect themselves
from excess sunlight and tune photosynthetic output by safely dissipating or rerouting energy when
needed.
To learn design principles that could mimic these capabilities, we must first understand the underlying
molecular mechanisms that govern natural photoprotection and photoadaptation. The research will
focus on understanding and learning to control such mechanisms in the phycobilisome, which is the
main light-harvesting antenna protein complex of cyanobacteria.
Recent single-complex and single-molecule level studies of phycobilisomes have revealed surprising
evidence of photodynamics originating on multiple length scales – from single pigments, to structural
rearrangements, to interactions with other proteins such as the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP).
Although OCP is known to quench the phycobilisome and recently its binding site for one species has
been discovered, the dynamics and detailed mechanism of quenching are still not well understood, and
where it binds to other phycobilisome architectures is not known.
The goals of the research are to (1) discover the molecular origin of the different photophysical states of
phycobilisomes with and without quenching, using single-particle spectroscopic measurements of their
properties and dynamics, (2) test the hypothesis that these states are induced by changes in incident
light or other environmental parameters to learn whether they are indeed photoadaptive or
photoprotective, and (3) determine to what degree we can exert control over these mechanisms.
Building a mechanistic bottom-up view of the intrinsic photodynamic sophistication of phycobilisomes is
essential for extending our biological understanding of photosynthesis, and provides highly
complementary insights to more traditional research approaches. The outcomes of the research will
impact future advances in alternative energy technologies and engineering crops for food security.

Continuous Redox-Mediated Electrochemical Liquid-Liquid Extraction
for Critical Element Recovery
Dr. Xiao Su, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Urbana, IL 61801
Platinum group metals (PGMs) are used in many modern technologies but are difficult to recover and
purify because of their low natural abundance, complex and environmentally dependent chemical
states, and structural similarity. Electrochemical approaches offer a promising pathway to promote
selective separation of PGM for their recovery while also reducing waste generated and enabling
reusability. This project investigates how the structure of homogeneous redox-active extractants can be
tuned to affect the selective separation of PGM chloro-anions under electrochemical control. Insight
into both short- and long-range interactions are sought through a combination of single-site design and
controllable surfactant self-assembly to maximize selectivity, regeneration, and uptake of PGM ions. The
scientific objectives include the synthesis of soluble, electrochemically responsive molecules that
selectively bind to PGMs; the mechanistic evaluation of how metals and extractants distribute between
different liquid phases and assemble at interfaces using advanced operando techniques; and the
selection of electrolytes and solvents for enhanced conductivity. This project, which focuses on
establishing molecular design principles for developing new continuous electrochemical separations for
critical element recovery, has the potential to advance understanding of non-thermal separation
mechanisms.

Accelerated Robotic Design of Energy Materials (ACE lab)
Dr. Carolin M. Sutter-Fella, Staff Scientist
Molecular Foundry

Berkeley, CA 94720
Chirality describes a property where an object or molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. It
is fundamental to the processes of life, and is ubiquitous in Nature e.g. nucleic acids, amino acids, and
sugars. Chiral semiconductors can enable control over spin, charge, and light without the need for
magnetic components. Such materials would be pivotal for next-generation technologies spanning
quantum computing, encryption, and drug screening. Although there are numerous organic chiral
molecules, their structural softness and poor electrical properties prevent them from wide-spread
application. Recently, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors have emerged as new class of
chiral semiconductors combining asymmetry with outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, their
optical properties associated with the chiral molecules (chiroptical properties) are currently too weak for
practical applications. Thus, to harness the full potential of chiral perovskites requires not only a
fundamental understanding of synthesis-process-structure-chiroptical activity relationships but also a
systematic search of the multidimensional compositional parameter space.
This project aims to uncover structure-chiroptical activity relationships to significantly enhance
chiroptical properties and to discover new chiral perovskites by developing the Accelerated Robotic
Design of Energy Materials (ACE) lab. ACE lab integrates robotics and real-time data collection with the
use of machine learning-driven data interpretation and decision-making to accelerate progress of this
promising material class. ACE lab will be a next-generation robotic platform operating autonomously to
directly optimize properties with real-time characterization feedback allowing for in-the-fly learning and
control. Success of this project impacts the deployment of advanced technologies. Once this research
project is accomplished, the ACE lab concept can be naturally expanded to engage a broader materials
science community to systematically contribute to the fundamental understanding of oxides, inorganic,
organic, and hybrid semiconductors. ACE lab will be established at the Molecular Foundry User Facility
at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) and thus, will be accessible for the broad materials science
community, in addition to providing a state-of-the-art multidisciplinary training platform for the future
workforce.

Quantum Control for Nuclear EDM Experiments
William Terrano, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281
Two of the biggest questions in physics converge in nuclear physics: why, in the early universe, is more
matter created than anti-matter, given that they are otherwise so similar? And, why is the interaction
that binds a nucleus together (the strong force) the same if time runs backwards, while the interaction
that governs nuclear decay (the weak force) is not? The detection of the first intrinsic nuclear electric
dipole moment would go a long way towards resolving both of these mysteries. The project here is to
maximize the “quantum advantage” of the next generation of nuclear EDM searches by extending
their coherent integration time. Our research will focus on the super-position state of the xenon-129
nuclear spin, whose coherence time we aim to extend by as much as a factor of 35, to the theoretical
limit set by decoherence of the stationary states. We will use a combination of precision measurement
techniques to tune away non-linear interactions, and quantum control techniques to ensure the optimal
superposition state is created every time. Each improvement to the integration time will directly
improve the sensitivity of the next xenon EDM measurement, planned for 2026 at LANL, by an equal
factor.

Advancing the Quantum Magnetism Frontier in the Topology Era
Dr. Jörn Venderbos, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Department of Materials Science and Engineering
Drexel University
Philadelphia, PA 19104
Topology is now firmly established as one of the organizing core principles for our understanding of
quantum phases of matter. This is not only true for insulators and metals that are well-described by
single-particle physics, but also extends to materials with strong correlations, such as magnets and
superconductors. The goal of this project is to advance the theory of topological magnetism and bridge
the gap between formal classifications of magnetic topological phases, which are known, and
identifying, interrogating, and controlling such phases in real materials, which remains a key challenge.
This is in fact a broader challenge for topological phases with strong interactions and stems in part from
the formidable effort often required to gain insight into the behavior of materials which exhibit strong
correlations between electrons. Several new frontiers in quantum magnetism, which have exposed
unexplored properties of magnetic materials, offer a highly compelling opportunity to advance our
understanding of correlations and topology. These include the observation and control of magnetism in
layered van der Waals materials, even down to monolayer systems, and the discovery of new types of
magnets - referred to as "altermagnets" - which provide unexpected venues for topological magnetism.
The design of this project leverages and further advances these developments in key areas. The central
objectives include developing methods to study, characterize, and predict the experimentally accessible
charge and magnetic excitations in topological magnetic metals and insulators, and the exploration of
pathways for realizing new topological phases by quantum and thermal melting of unconventional
magnetic order. In a broad sense, this project offers a roadmap for advancing our understanding of
magnetism in the topology era to fruitfully connect and exploit the realms of ideas, models, and
materials.

Polymer Origami – A Blueprint for Hierarchical Folding of Sequence-Controlled Multiblock Copolymers
Dr. Thi Vo, Assistant Professor
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Johns Hopkins University
Baltimore, MD 21218-2625
Advances in chemistry have produced a class of multiblock polymers constructed via combining
sequence-controlled oligomeric blocks and flexible amorphous blocks. These polymers are of interest
due to their ability to self-organize into 2D nanosheets and simple 3D polyhedra. Such directed chain
folding is reminiscent of biopolymers folding into proteins ubiquitously found throughout Nature. While
not as structurally sophisticated, this class of polymers provides a model platform for studies aimed at
translating complexities intrinsic to biological systems to synthetic materials. Successfully converting
Nature’s blueprint for protein folding to operate on synthetic polymers will open unprecedented
avenues for their applications in stimuli-responsive, filtration, and catalytic materials.
The bottleneck in designing polymer folding, however, lies in parameter space complexity. Many of the
polymer subunits utilized in synthesis possess complex shapes and sizes. As a result, folding prediction
requires an understanding of the interplay between geometry, connectivity, and directional interactions
in sculpting the assembled structures. Our proposal will address this challenge in materials design by
combining theory and simulation to elucidate the driving forces governing polymer folding. Insights from
our works will be leveraged to design a library of polymers for immediate synthesis. These designs
include porous nanostructures for separation or catalytic applications as well as reconfigurable
morphologies for usage as actuators in soft robotics. Our work will not only establish polymer origami as
a synthetic analog of protein folding, but also highlight universal principles that underpin
macromolecular folding processes. The latter means that our findings can complement approaches
being used for protein engineering, providing transformative impacts beyond polymer self-assembly.

The physics of atomic nuclei is crucial to understanding the origin of visible matter, the lifecycle of stars,
developing novel medical radiotherapies, enabling robust and safe nuclear energy, and ensuring our
national security and nuclear forensics. Unfortunately, nuclear physics is complicated, especially when it
comes to extremely short-lived, highly radioactive nuclei, which are exceedingly difficult to measure in a
lab or predictively model with modern theoretical tools while still being extremely important to the
applications above. This project will develop the theory and tools needed to predict the properties of
such nuclei on near-term quantum computers that will come online within the next decade. Exploiting
the exponentially growing computational space that quantum computers offer, the research will enable
fully microscopic prediction of nuclear properties that are impossible, even in the post-exascale era,
with classical high-performance computing. By treating quantum computers as digitally controllable
analog simulators, efficient simulations will be realized, making full use of available modern and near-
term quantum resources. This research will develop these novel hybrid digital-analog simulations of
nuclear dynamics, rooting dynamics within effective field theories and deriving the optimal mapping
between the nuclear dynamics and the physical dynamics of the quantum platform.

Developing low-threshold liquid argon time projection chambers with photo-sensitive dopants
for dark matter and neutrino experiments
Dr. Shawn Westerdale, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy
University of California, Riverside
Riverside, CA 92521
Liquid argon is an often-used material for detecting fundamental particles due to the large signals it
makes when particles deposit energy in it. Its inexpensive price, transparency, and purity allow liquid
argon detectors to be scaled to very large sizes, up to hundreds or thousands of tons, making it a
powerful tool for measuring rare fundamental particle interactions that can ionize the argon target. A
particular kind of liquid argon detector, a time projection chamber (TPC) equipped with photodetectors,
is sensitive to scintillation light and ionization electrons produced in these interactions and can
therefore measure low-energy signals. This project will explore the possibility of enhancing the
performance of these detectors by doping the liquid argon with so-called “photo-sensitive” dopants that
have ionization energies lower than argon, and thus allow lower-energy interactions to produce
detectable ionization electron signals. These dopants may also convert some of the scintillation photons
produced in the interaction to additional ionization electrons, which are more efficiently measured in a
TPC. Furthermore, because the dopants are rich in hydrogen—the lightest element there is—they may
increase sensitivity to interactions with very low-mass dark matter particles, neutrons, or neutrinos. This
project addresses several technical challenges to building doped-argon detectors and explores the
impact of dopants on low-energy signals, paving the way for future dark matter and neutrino
experiments, among other potential applications.

Tuning Electrocatalytic Reduction of Plasma Pre-Activated CO Toward Multicarbon Products

Upgrading CO to chemicals and fuels could provide a scalable strategy for mitigating climate change.
2
Electrochemical conversion of CO with water under mild conditions that are compatible with renewable
2
energy could provide a low-carbon approach compared to alternatives that require H or high
2
temperature and pressure. However, electrocatalytic CO reduction with H O (CO R) is rate-limited by
2 2 2
the CO or CO activation step. This limitation also constrains catalyst design to favor CO /CO activation
2 2
at the expense of tuning catalytic pathways toward high-value multicarbon products. Nonthermal
plasma has accomplished CO conversion at atmospheric pressure, but the non-selective nature of
2
plasma makes it challenging to control the subsequent conversion to valuable products.
This project will unlock new electrocatalyst design spaces for multicarbon product generation using
CO /CO pre-activation with nonthermal plasma. We hypothesize that by applying nonthermal plasma in
2
CO R for the first time as an approach that is outside the conventional scope of catalyst development,
2
we may help solve outstanding challenges in electrocatalytic CO upgrading to high-value products. This
2
strategy would address the limitations of existing approaches to electrocatalytic CO R by decoupling
2
reactant/intermediate activation and product formation using plasma pre-activation, opening a wider
design space for electrocatalysts optimized for selective product generation further along the reaction
pathway. Based on coupling plasma with electrocatalysts across a novel engineered interface, the
proposed research will uncover new reaction pathways, materials, and catalyst design strategies for
electrocatalytic reduction of pre-activated CO to C products. The results are expected to have broad
2 3+
implications for development of new classes of electrocatalysts for CO reduction, as well as for opening

Mechanisms of Non-Equilibrium Ion Dynamics in Radiation Tolerant Alloys
Dr. Mitchell A. Wood, Principal Member of the Technical Staff
Center for Computing Research
Sandia National Laboratories
Albuquerque, NM 87123
This project will advance the frontiers of knowledge that underpin our nation’s fusion energy capabilities
by addressing one of the key limiting factors of a viable pilot plant; the survivability of plasma facing
materials. One of the main challenges in understanding the cumulative effects of radiation damage in
structural and functional materials lies in the ultrafast dynamics after an energetic collision with the
lattice. Our limited scientific understanding of degradation and component lifetime predictions when
exposed to these environments stands as a roadblock to commercially available inertial and magnetic
confinement fusion energy power plants. The extremely fast timescale (10−11s) and large excess of
energy (104 - 107eV) imparted into the material during neutron and charge particle exposure are
inadequately described by the assumptions of equilibrium dynamics. It is hypothesized that primary
recoil damage and defect recombination involve high-energy, non-equilibrium electronic excitations that
alter the potential energy surface and subsequent ion dynamics. This activates fundamentally different
damage accumulation mechanisms and populations than those inferred from simple equilibrium
theories in metals. Downstream phenomena emerging at longer length and time scales (chemical
segregation, mechanical response, and thermal transport) are intimately linked to these initial transient
non-equilibrium behaviors. The material selection to test these theories on reflect leading candidates for
plasma facing (WReOs) and structural components (Oxide dispersoid strengthened steels). Work done
here to unveil the fundamental radiation damage accumulation mechanisms and advancement of our
modeling and simulation capability transcends the specific technical application where this effort will
generate a wake of research efforts centered on matter in extreme environments where many modern
science and engineering challenges lie.

Machine-Learning Enabled Field-level Inference for Primordial Gravitational Wave Discovery

Inflation is a leading paradigm for describing the earliest moments of the universe. The search for a key
signature from inflation, imprints of primordial gravitational waves (PGW) on the B-mode polarization of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), is a major goal of many current- and next-generation CMB
experiments. SPT-3G and BICEP/Keck are two leading experiments in this search: with SPT-3G providing
a template of the lensing B modes to delens the BICEP/Keck maps, thus removing a major contaminant
to the PGW B-mode search. The planned work enables the incorporation of otherwise foreground-
contaminated temperature data in an optimal lensing estimate by approximating the probability
distributions of extragalactic foreground fields using generative neural networks. The trained generative
network will be part of a hybrid analytic and simulation-based likelihood when performing cosmological
parameter inference on million-pixel maps. The gain in precision on PGWs B modes from including the
SPT-3G temperature data is equivalent to a substantial extension to the SPT-3G survey time. This project
will produce leading constraints on PGWs with data from the two most established experiments in this
search, SPT-3G and BICEP/Keck. The techniques developed will be broadly applicable and impactful for
the cosmology community for analyses of survey data on small scales such as those from DESI and

This research aims to develop, implement, validate, and apply parallel randomized algorithms for solving
large-scale and multiscale problems in electromagnetics and multiphysics. These problems, governed by
Fredholm integral equations (IEs) of the first or second kind or by partial differential equations (PDEs) of
the elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic type, are crucial in understanding electromagnetic and optical
wave interactions with matter. Such interactions are fundamental to numerous modern sciences and
technologies, involving high-frequency wave radiation, transmission, propagation, and scattering in
complex media and their interaction with charged particles.
Numerical modeling and simulation are vital for research and development in these areas, but the
multiphysics, multiscale, and nonlinear interactions between electromagnetics and other physical
phenomena present significant challenges to existing deterministic numerical methods. This research
aims to overcome these challenges by developing novel parallelized randomized algorithms for IEs and
PDEs, enhancing the simulation efficiency of traditional deterministic algorithms. The project’s major
scope includes:
1. Developing randomized IE solvers using randomized factorization, matrix compression, and
projection techniques for large-scale electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems.
2. Creating randomized hyperbolic and parabolic PDE solvers for multiscale electromagnetic and
multiphysics problems.
3. Designing efficient parallel randomized solvers for large-scale computations based on the UPC++

these advanced tools to investigate the motion and evolution of defects that govern plasticity in RCCAs
across multiple length scales, including local atomic environments that control vacancy and dislocation

The periphery of toroidal magnetic confinement fusion plasma, commonly known as the edge or

including fusion pilot plants (FPPs). Recognizing its importance, the study of edge plasmas, particularly in
tokamak devices, has been a significant component of magnetic fusion energy (MFE) research for over
three decades. Despite this, critical issues, such as edge plasma exhaust in the presence of stochastic
magnetic fields, remain unresolved due to the complexity of the problem. Moreover, existing edge

software, and numerical algorithms nor suited for FPP-relevant applications, such as efficient core-edge-
SOL integration and automated divertor design and optimization. This project will first develop a
modeling framework with built-in capabilities that facilitate sensitivity studies and design optimization
for FPPs as well as new edge transport and turbulence models for multiple magnetic configurations
upon this framework, and then better understand and quantify edge plasma exhaust dynamics within a
stochastic magnetic field, either externally applied, self-generated or both, through theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations enabled by these new models. This work aims to address critical R&D topics

nutrient cycling. This research focuses on developing mathematical models and high-throughput
validation experiments for the five most abundant soil bacteria to understand their metabolism in
response to changes in pH and temperature. These two environmental variables have been shown to
play a key role in plant productivity, both in natural environments and in agroecosystems. Once these
pH and temperature genome-scale models are built and validated, they can be used to perform
simulations to further understand ‒and eventually control‒ the necessary metabolic processes that
affect nutrient synthesis and cycling within different ecosystems. The results of this project will increase
our fundamental understanding of relevant soil microorganisms, potentially enabling new model-driven
interventions for resilient bioenergy crops and carbon sequestration. This dual experimental and
computational project is conducted by a diverse team that includes postdoctoral, graduate, and
undergraduate researchers. Members of the team will engage in learning and teaching computational
biology activities, thus training the next generation of computational biologists to tackle the most critical
challenges in predictive biogeochemistry and environmental microbiome science.
This research was selected for funding by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research.
