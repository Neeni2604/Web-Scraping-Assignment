Towards Facile Synthesis of High-Entropy-Alloy and Complex Concentrated Alloy Nanoparticles
Dr. Kandis Leslie Gilliard-Abdul Aziz, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering
University of California, Riverside
Riverside, CA 92507
This research will develop a facile synthesis strategy for complex concentrated alloy (CCA) nanoparticles
using the solid-state self-assembly of nanoparticles from thin films of oxide precursor materials. Complex
concentrated alloy (CCA) nanoparticles, including high-entropy alloys (HEA), have unique physical and
chemical properties for many applications, such as catalysis, sensing, hydrogen storage, and energy-
related applications. The synergy between the electronic interactions of the metals is advantageous for
various electro- and thermo- catalytic reactions where the nanoparticles display superior stability,
selectivity, and activity compared to conventional alloys. Despite their unique properties, the synthesis of
these materials is complex, which limits their use beyond laboratory demonstrations. The objectives of
this project will employ in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ microscopy techniques to track
the nanoparticle‚Äôs bulk diffusion, nucleation, and growth as a function of thin film oxide properties. The
project outcomes will be transformative, as the study will couple fundamental understanding from the
characterization of thin films to develop a new synthesis strategy for laboratory-scale development of
supported CCA and HEA nanoparticles.

Probing Nuclear Dipole Responses
Dr. Philip Adsley, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy and Cyclotron Institute
Texas A&M University
College Station, Texas 77840
The way that nuclei respond to electromagnetic radiation has profound implications for neutron stars, f
or the synthesis of heavy elements, for nuclear medicine, and even industrial applications such as the
design of nuclear reactors. Of particular importance is the dipole response of nuclei which causes protons
and neutrons to oscillate in opposite directions. This response causes one side of the nucleus to have more
positive charge than the other. Many contributions to the nuclear dipole response overlap and are hard
to isolate. Additionally, isolating the contributions is made more difficult due to deficiencies in past
measurements. The present research uses sensitive experimental probes of the nuclear dipole response
to resolve these different contributions. This research will also develop independent calibration standards
for dipole response measurements to validate modern experimental studies and investigate historical
experimental discrepancies. Experiments will be performed at three laboratories with different
capabilities: the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute, ùõæELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-
Rossendorf in Germany, the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Science in Cape Town, South
Africa. The results from each type of experiment will probe different aspects of the nuclear dipole
response.

Tuning Bulk and Interfacial Electrolyte Solvation to Control Electrochemical Transformations
Dr. Chibueze Amanchukwu, Neubauer Family Assistant Professor
Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering
The University of Chicago
Chicago, IL 60637
Electrochemical energy technologies such as batteries, water electrolysis, and carbon dioxide/carbon
monoxide reduction (CO RR/COR) are required for clean energy and to transform manufacturing. Across
2
all these technologies, water is essential and can be a reactant and solvent. Carbon monoxide reduction
(COR) to C products such as ethylene (C H ) exposes water‚Äôs undesirable dilemma: How might we
2+ 2 4
enhance high selectivity for hydrogenated products such as C H while suppressing undesired water
2 4
breakdown to yield hydrogen? The challenges facing electrochemical devices could be solved if we
improved our fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena at solid/liquid interfaces that then
allows us to optimally control electrochemical transformations under applied potentials. Here, we
propose to control water‚Äôs availability and solvation to control its reactivity in electrochemical
transformations such as COR. To tune water‚Äôs behavior, we will remove its duality and confine it as solely
a reactant. Coupling electrolyte solvation control with novel catalyst design that enhances carbon coupling
will allow for selective and efficient COR to hydrogenated products. Fundamental insights generated from
this work will enhance our understanding of bulk solvation effects and interfacial molecular sciences at
the catalyst/electrolyte interface and provide a pathway for clean energy deployment and transformative
future manufacturing.

Developing Techniques to Enable Intelligent Dynamic Reconfigurable Computing for Sparse Scientific
Problems
Dr. Bahar Asgari, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
University of Maryland, College Park
College Park, MD 20742
To efficiently scale the performance of scientific computing in the post-Moore's Law era, this research
proposes techniques for developing intelligent, dynamically reconfigurable systems to allow diverse
workloads to reach their peak performance without sacrificing performance for common cases. For
years, scientific computing has relied on commodity computing platforms equipped with general-
purpose programmable processors. Even though such platforms have been able to deliver the required
computational throughput (i.e., FLOPS), their scalability and energy/cost efficiency are concerning in the
post-Moore's Law era. One reason for this is the inherent contradiction that scientific computing
workloads are typically sparse, while computing platforms have been designed for dense data. As a
result, even high-end supercomputers like Frontier and Fugaku achieve no more than 0.8% and 3% of
their peak FLOPS, respectively, when running the sparse HPCG benchmark. To improve computation
efficiency and resource utilization, hardware specialization can be employed, but it is not practical since
it is a slow and costly process, and one specialized solution cannot fit the diverse requirements of
scientific computing workloads. To address this challenge, this research develops techniques for
intelligent dynamic reconfigurability, unifying hardware and software in a holistic manner, adapting
them together to run a program or multiple programs efficiently. As proof of concept, we prototype our
techniques using available FPGA technologies, providing insights for further improvement. This research
covers various levels of the computing stack, from user interface and algorithm optimizations to
computer architecture and hardware, and explores both traditional and modern techniques, such as
integrating machine learning into the configuration environment. Ultimately, the goal of this research is
to democratize efficient high-performance computing for scientists across diverse fields, from physics
and medical sciences to various engineering domains.

Extending the Reach of Light Source Facilities with Precision Laser Plasma Injectors
Dr. Sam Barber, Research Scientist
Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
Particle accelerator-driven light source facilities provide an invaluable tool to a robust community of
scientific users. In particular, the x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) stands out as it allows scientists
unparalleled access to spatial and temporal scales at the angstrom and femtosecond scale, respectively.
Advances in FEL physics and improvements in the constituent accelerator components are now needed
to make new research paradigms accessible. With this in mind, a radical new approach to the generation
and acceleration of electron beams is gaining widespread attention for its potential to produce ultra-high
brightness electron beams, which in turn promises a major breakthrough in XFEL performance both for
current facility upgrades and new facilities. With regards to the stringent stability and reliability
requirements of light source facilities, however, plasma-based accelerators have thus far remained
notably deficient. The primary goal of this research is to demonstrate the production of ultra-high
brightness electron beams generated by a laser plasma accelerator (LPA) with a level of stability, precision
control and reliability comparable to the rigorous requirements of light source facilities. This work will
provide a blueprint for the development of a plasma-based modality of electron beam injectors which can
revolutionize light source facilities in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, i) injector upgrades
for large scale facilities like the Linac Coherent Light Source and ii) driving complementary plasma-based
light sources at existing facilities or at future compact facilities with unique capabilities.

Shining New Light on the Dark Sector
Dr. Maria (Masha) Baryakhtar, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Washington
Seattle, Washington 98195
Most of our universe is dark. It is dark literally---visible mater makes up only 5% of the total energy
content---and conceptually, as known particles populate just a few of 60 orders of magnitude in mass
between the lightest (Hubble) and the highest (Planck) known particle physics scales. Within this vast
range, we believe outstanding theoretical questions are answered at scales far more energetic than those
we can access directly. This includes theories that address puzzles of low-scale symmetries as well as
frameworks such as string theory that seek to solve quantum gravity. Both generically predict new
ultralight, feebly interacting particles known as axions that are also excellent dark mater candidates. The
discovery of the axion, or one of its ultralight particle cousins, would shed light on our dark universe and
throw open a window on the highest energy scales.
This project will develop the theoretical foundation for novel axion and ultralight particle searches in the
sky and in the lab, following a three-pronged approach. The first direction is investigation of experimental
approaches in the search for axion and ultralight particle dark mater, specifically new photonic structure
designs which can enable dark mater to convert to visible light. Second, ultralight particles that are a
smaller component of the energy content of the universe may explain discrepant measurements of the
expansion rate of the universe at early and late times; this project will advance cosmological tests of these
ultralight particles and connect them to laboratory probes. Finally, new particles may exist but not be
present as dark mater. The extreme environments of black holes and neutron stars can create ultralight
particles in their vicinity and this project will study these unusual dynamics and develop precise
observational strategies for their detection. These three approaches will cast a wide net for axions and
ultralight particles to reveal the dark constituents of our universe and of the theoretical framework which
underlies it.

Accurate and Precise Weak Lensing Analyses for Cosmological Surveys
Dr. Mathew R. Becker, Assistant Physicist
High Energy Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
The acceleration of the expansion of the Universe is one of the biggest mysteries in
cosmology today. The scientific community and the Department of Energy (DOE) have
embarked upon a series of grand cosmological experiments to solve this enigma. These
experiments will make multiwavelength observations of the night sky at an
unprecedented scale in data volume and quality. The largest DOE cosmological
experiment that will observe optical wavelengths of light is the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
This observatory, once completed, will execute the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST) of the entire Southern Hemisphere night sky, producing some of the largest
volume catalogs of distant galaxies to date. By carefully studying the statistical properties
of the shapes of these galaxies, scientists can learn about the properties of accelerated
cosmic expansion. These studies, called weak gravitational lensing studies, are challenging
to perform in cosmological surveys due to multiple experimental and theoretical
uncertainties. The research funded by this Early Career Award will develop a new
measurement technique for weak gravitational lensing called deep-field metadetection
and apply it to the LSST. Deep-field metadetection will extract weak gravitational lensing
signals from LSST with approximately 15% less noise than previous-generation
measurement techniques while remaining unbiased. The commensurate gains in
constraints on the degree of cosmic acceleration from weak gravitational lensing will be
equivalent to nearly doubling the number of observations taken during the LSST. This
research program will make fundamental contributions to the Rubin Observatory LSST
and our understanding of cosmic acceleration.

Enhanced Fine-Scale Statistical Modeling of Environmental Extreme Events in
Complex Systems from Multiple Sources
Dr. Julie Bessac, Computational
Statistician National Renewable Energy
Laboratory Golden, CO 80401
The overarching goal of this research program is to develop novel general statistical models, combining
classic methods with deep learning, to advance the understanding and modeling of extreme events
arising in complex systems, which are characterized by multimodal (multisource) and multiscale outputs.
We are motivated by the drastic impacts of environmental extreme events on human systems or other
natural systems. Simulations from physics-based models tend to underestimate extreme intensities or
misrepresent trajectories or spreads of extremes, and would hence benefit from observation-driven
statistical correction (potentially online) or post-treatment. The misrepresentation of extremes leads to
misevaluated risks for systems and living populations suffering from extreme environmental stressors. In
turns, this results in inadequate responses and increased exposure or costs, such as the 2021 Texas
power crisis and the recent Hurricane Ian demonstrated. This highlights the need to understand and
mitigate environmental extremes, especially in a world of changing climates and extremes. Our working
hypothesis relies on the fine-scale observation-based statistical enhancement of low-frequency and
dynamical content summary statistics from physics-based model simulations to improve the
representation of extreme events i.e. their intensity, spatiotemporal extent and associated
uncertainties. Our research objective is to augment traditional statistical models with flexible neural
network techniques in the development of (1) summary statistics of extremes from multiple large-scale
numerical model outputs; (2) coupling derived large-scale summaries with fine-scale statistics of
observational extremes; (3) accounting for temporal dynamics between normal and extreme conditions
as well as long- term changes observed on measurements and projected model outputs; and (4)
developing statistical metrics adequate to extremes to validate the proposed strategy and generally
assess extremes from various datasets. These statistical models will serve as a post-treatment of
numerical model outputs with enhanced representations of extremes or will be used online to provide
corrections and more accurate simulations.
The significance of this program resides in advancing the understanding and predictability of observed
and simulated complex systems, which is a central mission of DOE that covers many application
domains such as climate and weather models, power grid systems, or building science. These systems
have experienced the impact of changing extreme events and environmental stressors. Hence, it is
critical to advance the understanding and predictability of extremes to adapt preparedness and
emergency management responses.

Towards a quantum-enhanced multi-cavity haloscope for high-mass QCD axion detection
Dr. Christian Boutan, Physicist
Physical Detection Systems &
Deployment
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99352
The nature of dark mater is one of the most perplexing open questions in physics today. The axion is a
compelling hypothetical particle that could account for the dark mater in our universe, while
simultaneously explaining why quark interactions within the neutron do not appear to give rise to an
electric dipole moment. Current approaches to detect dark mater axions rely on resonant microwave
cavities. The most sensitive detection technique in the 1‚Äì10 GHz frequency range‚Äîa range motivated
by numerous theoretical predictions‚Äîmakes use of the axion-photon coupling and is called the ‚Äúaxion
haloscope‚Äù. Axions are resonantly converted into detectable microwave photons in a tunable, high-Q
cavity permeated by a strong magnetic field. Existing direct-detection axion dark mater experiments are
expected to explore the 1‚Äì4 GHz range of the well-motivated frequency decade. Future detectors
designed to leverage traditional haloscope techniques to search above 4 GHz will face significant
challenges. Decreased detector volume and an increase in quantum noise conspire to make axion
detection nearly impossible without new strategies to boost signal and reduce noise at these higher
frequencies. The implementation of multi-cavity systems and readout based on quantum sensing are
promising approaches to address the loss in sensitivity. However, these approaches must be synthesized
into a mutually compatible experiment concept to reach target sensitivity. Furthermore, solutions to
improve detector sensitivity come at the cost of increased complexity‚Äîa complexity that may not be
tractable without advanced automated detector controls at high frequencies. Taking a broad view and
treating the solution-compatibility and experiment-complexity problems as a single entangled
challenge, this research will address both with the help of a new multi-cavity research and development
platform. The project will start from a systems engineering perspective and stress test promising
techniques together under realistic data-taking conditions. Specifically, two interconnected haloscope
scalability tasks will be undertaken: 1) the union of the multi-cavity approach with a readout based on
quantum sensing and 2) the adaptation of machine learning techniques for detector controls to combat
the trend towards increasing complexity. The result will point toward a synthesized strategy for
detecting the elusive axion above 4 GHz.

Epitaxially Imposed Control of Chiral Transport Phenomena
Dr. Mathew Brahlek, R&D Staff Scientist
Materials Science and Technology Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
Many novel quantum and topological phenomena in materials are derived from or exhibit chirality, a lack
of mirror symmetry. These phenomena range from novel forms of superconductivity to unusual one-
dimensional (1D) states that are bound to the edge of a material. Both quantum and topological
phenomena are critical elements for new classes of quantum devices and sensors, called chiraltronics.
The overarching goal of this project is to create new chiral material paradigms for which symmetry and
dimensionality can be directly controlled by tailoring atomically precise interfaces. These new material
platforms can be tailored to elucidate how lattice, electronic, and magnetic characters determine and
affect chiral phenomena. This understanding is a critical step toward new applications. To achieve this
goal, this project will be subdivided into two tasks: (1) deploying new atomic-scale structures that can be
used to stabilize and understand unusual, low-dimension chiral states and (2) understanding how
materials with chiral structures and unusual coupling of the spin and momentum (altermagnets) can
interface with superconductors to attain desired functionalities. Achieving the objectives of this project
requires a strong synergy between thin-film synthesis using molecular beam epitaxy and advanced
characterization of quantum and topological phenomena in the materials. This feat will lead to the ability
to control and fingerprint chiral phenomena and will ultimately reveal fundamental design principles for
a new generation of quantum materials with transformative possibilities.

Nuclear Tomography through Entanglement-Enabled Spin Interference
Dr. James Daniel Brandenburg, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Ohio State University
Columbus, Ohio 43210
Protons and Neutrons are the basic building blocks of almost all visible mater in the Universe.
Astonishingly, the rules that govern these basic building blocks dictate the mater formed over 18 orders
of magnitude in scale ‚Äì from tiny atomic nuclei to massive astronomical objects like neutron stars.
However, protons and neutrons are not fundamental, but are themselves dynamical quantum objects
built from quarks that are ‚Äòglued‚Äô together by gluon particles which mediates the strong nuclear force. A
fundamental goal of nuclear physics over the last several decades has been to understand the internal
structure of protons, neutrons, and nuclei. To this end, one of the primary goals of the future Electron
Ion Collider is to construct multi-dimensional maps of the quarks and gluons within large nuclear
objects. This project utilizes a recently discovered quantum effect in which entanglement enables
wavefunction interference between distinguishable particles. Hidden in these interference patterns is
information about the distribution of gluons within protons, neutrons, and large nuclei ‚Äì enabling a new
approach to nuclear tomography. This project undertakes the development of this newfound quantum
effect to explore the dynamic properties of gluons within large nuclei and to investigate the details of
their quantum spin structure. By developing this novel entanglement-driven technique, this project also
aims at providing new opportunities to impact searches for physics beyond the Standard Model and for
investigating nuclei as entangled quantum objects.

Engineering Continuous Trait Variation in Bioenergy Feedstocks to Optimize Growth on Marginal Lands
Dr. Jennifer Brophy, Assistant Professor
Bioengineering Department
Stanford
University
Stanford, CA
94305
Bioenergy crops constitute an important renewable source of raw material to produce fuels and
chemicals. To be economically viable without competing with food and feed crops, these crops must be
able to grow in soils with low water and nutrient contents. Sorghum has great potential as a bioenergy
crop due to its high biomass yield and drought tolerance. However, new varieties are needed to tolerate
increasing water, nutrient, and temperature stresses caused by climate change. A commonly used
approach to generate improved yield and stress tolerance in sorghum relies on genetic analysis of large
sorghum populations, which takes a long time. Furthermore, relatively little is known about the traits
involved in abiotic stress tolerance, hindering crop improvement through breeding and genetic
engineering. This research will develop a novel approach to understanding and optimizing root
architecture traits. Synthetic biology strategies will be used in sorghum and a model grass to generate a
series of plants with increasing root depth or branch density. Engineered plants will be studied to
understand the roles of root features in stress resilience. With these tools, this project will accelerate
the development of optimal bioenergy crop varieties and contribute to the establishment of a vigorous
bioeconomy, ensuring energy stability in the face of a changing climate.

Shining Light on the Higgs Self-Interaction
Dr. Elizabeth Brost, Associate Scientist
Physics Department
Brookhaven National
Laboratory Upton, NY 11973
The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was a strong confirmation of the Standard Model (SM)
of particle physics. Nevertheless, a decade later, many outstanding questions about this new boson
remain, including its relation to electroweak symmetry breaking and how new physics might shape its
properties. Over the last decade, many properties of the Higgs have been measured with great precision,
while crucial other properties, such as the Higgs self-interaction, remain experimentally unconstrained.
Measuring the Higgs self-interaction and understanding its role in electroweak symmetry breaking is a
major goal of the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN), located near Geneva, Switzerland. The measurement can be performed directly
in extremely rare, high-energy collisions resulting in pairs of Higgs bosons. Innovative analysis techniques
and data collection methods will be required to observe such a rare process. This research program
therefore searches for effects of new physics on Higgs pair production using data collected by the ATLAS
(A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment at the LHC. A measurement of the Higgs self-interaction at the
LHC will either reaffirm the SM nature of the Higgs or point to new physics beyond the SM. Finally, to
ensure that ATLAS can make the best use of the data produced during the high luminosity running period
of the LHC, scheduled to begin later this decade, this research will develop novel techniques to select
interesting collision data in real time using machine learning algorithms in Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA)-based technology. The deployment of such sophisticated algorithms will enhance the search
sensitivity to Higgs pair production as well as other rare processes at the LHC. The analysis and data-
collection techniques developed through this project will advance our understanding of the Higgs boson
at unprecedented scales and shed light on the outstanding questions in particle physics, not only at the
LHC but also at the proposed future colliders.

Fixed-Field Superconducting Magnets for Rapid, High Power Acceleration of Muons and Protons
Dr. Lucas Brouwer, Research Scientist
Accelerator Technology & Applied Physics Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA, 94720
Future experiments in High Energy Physics require new particle accelerators with unprecedented need for
rapid, high-power acceleration. A promising paradigm to meet these demands is fixed-field acceleration,
in which alternating gradient magnet structures are employed to transport beams of different energy
without magnetic field change. Application of superconducting magnet technology to these unique
accelerator designs allows for higher bending fields and gradients, enabling more compact layouts with
larger accelerating energy range (reducing cost and improving performance). Yet, superconducting
magnet technology optimized for this application remains largely undemonstrated. The objective of this
research program is to address this gap in technology through optimization and test of a novel
superconducting magnet design tailored for fixed-field acceleration.

Assessing Climate Impacts on Coastal-urban Flooding Through High-resolution Barotropic and Baroclinic Ocean
Coupling
Dr. Steven Brus, Assistant Computational Scientist
Mathematics and Computer Science Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
The primary objective of this project is to bridge the divergent scales between the global climate drivers
of sea level rise and the local coastal impacts of extreme events in the Energy Exascale Earth System
Model (E3SM). This objective will be accomplished by unifying two classes of models: Earth system
models (ESMs) and barotropic coastal flooding models. ESMs incorporate interactions between separate
geophysical systems. Because of their complexity, however, the 3D ocean model components of these
ESMs operate at a resolution far coarser than what is needed to resolve complex coastal regions. On the
other hand, while 2D barotropic coastal flood models efficiently describe tidal and storm surge
processes at high resolution, they neglect density effects and lack connections to the climate drivers
associated with sea level rise.
Our project extends the mode-splitting approaches that ESM ocean models currently use to separate
fast, barotropic free-surface waves from slower, density-driven baroclinic flow. Such approaches
typically work by evolving the baroclinic mode at a larger time step than the barotropic mode. In
contrast, we will employ mode splitting in space as well as time, such that the barotropic and baroclinic
modes are two-way coupled between different resolution meshes. This coupling will enable an increase
in the horizontal resolution of the 2D barotropic mode, allowing the model to resolve tides and storm
surge in estuaries and rivers without the expense of refining the 3D baroclinic mode to coastal scales.
With this new capability, E3SM will be able to resolve coastal-urban flooding processes due to sea level
rise, tides, and storm surge in long-term climate simulations, enabling comprehensive studies of the
effects of climate change on extreme water levels in coastal-urban systems. The project will focus on the
major urban centers of the United States Mid-Atlantic region, with a particular emphasis on Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York City. The coastal-urban regions in this area experience exposure to extreme
flooding and associated risks related to the combination of tropical cyclones, tides, and sea level rise
under climate change. This project seeks to provide local stakeholders with a fully integrated assessment
of future flooding risks in these communities.

Expanding the Fundamental Understanding of At-211 Chemistry: Towards Improving Binding and
Complexation
Dr. Jonathan D. Burns, Ph.D.
Department of Chemistry
University of Alabama at Birmingham
Birmingham, AL 35294-0111
Astatine-211 (At-211) shows promise for cancer treatments when connected to a targeting agent like a
monoclonal antibody, especially for non-localized cancers. The challenges to utilizing At-211 in patients
are the availability of production, the relatively unknown chemistry of astatine, and the development
of appropriate targeting agents. Because of At-211‚Äôs short (7.2 h) half-life, this means that the number
of laboratories where development of radiotherapies and studies of the fundamental astatine
chemistry has been performed is limited.
The increasing demand for isotopes utilized in Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) has indicated the need to
develop systems and technologies to facilitate high yields, while minimizing the process time of
recovery for the radionuclide. Our overarching goal is to expand the fundamental chemistry of At-211
binding and complexation, so insights gained can be applied to developments in separations,
purifications, and chelating agents for this interesting and important element. Ultimately, an improved
understanding of At-211 could significantly decrease the time required for the recovery and use of this
TAT isotope, leading to an overall increase in the availability of At-211 for treatment as well as research
purposes.
To achieve the goal the following Specific Aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: Investigate the nature of AtO+ interactions with ketone ligands.
Specific Aim 2: Study the effects of other ligand types on the AtO+ extraction.
Specific Aim 3: Examine AtO+ behavior with zirconium phosphate nano-platelets.
Specific Aim 4: Enhance student and trainee recruitment, engagement, and involvement.
Ultimately, success in all four of these specific aims will influence the technologic development of not
only the At-211 recovery‚Äîas shown by our previous success with the 3-octanone system‚Äîbut will also
provide a foundation to transform this TAT isotope into a usable form, leading to an overall increase in
the availability of At-211 for treatment, as well as research purposes.

Elucidation and Validation of Genes Associated with Biological Nitrification Inhibition in Populus
Dr. John F. Cahill, Associate Scientist
Biological and Environmental Systems Science Directorate
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37831
To provide crops with the nitrogen they require for robust growth, nitrogen fertilizer is added to the soil
to increase yields. However, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in bioenergy crops such as poplar is low,
which may result in pollution of waterways by nitrate runoff, emissions of the potent greenhouse gas
nitrous oxide, and reduced carbon dioxide sequestration in soils. One of the main reasons for this low
NUE is the activity of microbes that convert soil nitrogen into nitrate and nitrous oxide in a process
called nitrification. Plant roots exudate chemicals (biological nitrification inhibitors or BNIs) that reduce
microbial nitrification. Thus, controlling the production of BNIs by roots can help mitigate nitrogen loss
and improve NUE in bioenergy crops. Despite substantial research in this area, little is known about the
genes and pathways involved in root BNI production. Furthermore, the current methodologies used to
analyze BNI-related traits in plant populations are inefficient. This project will use genome-wide
association analysis of a large poplar population to discover and characterize genes involved in the
production of BNIs and, therefore, understand their role affecting NUE. A high-throughput mass
spectrometry approach will be developed to analyze nitrification and mineralization in samples from the
soil surrounding poplar roots at an unprecedented scale, while metabolomics and soil nitrification
studies of root exudates will help identify BNI-associated genes. This knowledge will provide avenues to
increase NUE in bioenergy crops with the concomitant increase in carbon sequestration, given the tight
connection between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Furthermore, the outcomes of this project will
contribute to our understanding of ecosystem function and to inform the design and engineering of
more efficient bioenergy crops.

Deciphering the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Driven Phenomena in Quantum Materials
Dr. Yue Cao, Assistant Physicist
Materials Science Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Quantum materials host intriguing properties such as magnetism and superconductivity, because of the
cooperative behavior of the electrons (electronic order). The materials can provide the foundation for
next-generation quantum information science (QIS) systems and energy-efficient microelectronics if their
fundamental behavior is understood. A challenge is that the electronic order varies across the material
(i.e., it is spatially heterogeneous) because of the presence of different types and densities of defects (e.g.,
point defects and stacking faults) and of elastic strain. Harnessing the full potential of these materials thus
requires a fundamental understanding of how the heterogeneous electronic order responds to external
electromagnetic fields and controls macroscopic material properties, as well as of how the defect
landscape shapes the way that the electronic order evolves as a function of time.
This program seeks to develop fundamental knowledge of the relationships among spatial heterogeneity,
materials response to external stimuli, and the defect landscape in quantum materials, here specifically
in van der Waals (vdW) materials. To achieve this goal, this program will take advantage of the
unprecedented X-ray coherence from new and upgraded synchrotrons and free electron laser facilities.
We will probe how electronic order evolves on multiple length and time scales in a series of vdW materials
in response to external electric and optical excitations. The insights gained will enable rational design and
control of materials behavior by tuning the defect landscape. This will be relevant to applications in QIS,
clean energy, and microelectronics.

Viability of a Molten Salt Liquid Immersion Breeder Blanket System for Heat Removal and Power
Extraction in Fusion Devices
Dr. Lane Carasik, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering

University Richmond, Virginia
23284
Currently, the maturity of the magnetically confined fusion devices with molten salt based blanket
systems, referred to as liquid immersion blanket systems, is not as mature or well researched as liquid
metal or solid blanket systems. As a result, enabling Research & Development (R&D) necessary for liquid
immersion blankets and associated balance of plant (power conversion) technologies is needed for a
fusion power pilot plant. Specifically, this is to address the ability to do 1st wall and blanket heat exhaust
and power extraction with molten salts. This Fusion Energy Science (FES) career project will advance the
FES‚Äôs mission by focusing on enabling R&D for liquid immersion blanket concepts to support fusion power
pilot plant development. The aim of this research is to assess the ability to do heat exhaust and power
extraction needed by a fusion device within the megawatt range using a liquid immersion blanket system
and the molten salt, FLiBe. Crucially, these foundational studies will establish a baseline of system and
component-level performance requirements during steady-state and transient operations expected of a
fusion pilot plant.

Design of Molecular Spin Qubits Featuring Clock Transitions via Encapsulation
of f-Elements in Polyoxometalates
Dr. Korey P. Carter, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Iowa
Iowa City, IA 52242
Quantum information science (QIS) represents an emerging paradigm with the potential to revolutionize
a diverse range of scientific fields. To advance efforts within QIS, actinide polyoxometalate (POM)
complexes will be synthesized and tuned so that they can serve as quantum bits (qubits) for quantum
information processing applications. Multiple pathways have been explored for the physical realization of
qubits, which are at the core of any QIS system; however, electron spin-based qubits offer unmatched
promise if long coherence times can be realized. This is a multifaceted challenge as electron spin
superpositions are very sensitive to magnetic and environmental noise, which can result in decoherence
via multiple pathways. This project will focus on f-element complexes that feature atomic clock transitions
as this is a known route to protect electron spin qubits from external magnetic noise, thereby prolonging
the duration of coherence times within molecules. Atomic clock transitions originate from tunnel splitting
gaps that are a result of crystal field wavefunction mixing; however, there is limited knowledge on how to
consistently access these transitions within f-element complexes. The first stage of this project involves
the investigation of POM complexes with uranium, neptunium, and plutonium to identify species that
demonstrate desired values for coherence times and tunneling gaps. Using this knowledge, POM
complexes will then be synthetically tuned so that clock transitions can be accessed more systematically
in f-element complexes, and these efforts will be paired with extensive materials characterization,
including SQUID magnetometry, synchrotron, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magneto-infrared
spectroscopies, to elucidate a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the potential of atomic
clock transitions for QIS applications.

Understanding Implosion Physics Degradations to Advance IFE-Relevant Targets
Dr. Daniel Casey, Physicist, Low-Mode Working Group
Lead National Ignition Facility and Photon Science
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
Livermore, CA 94550
For half a century, researchers across the globe have worked to harness the potential for fusion energy to
provide clean electrical power for the indefinite future. Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) is one of two major
approaches and the recent achievement of ignition and gain >1 in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) at the
National Ignition Facility (NIF) has increased interest in IFE as a practical fusion energy solution.
Demonstrating ignition in the laboratory was a grand scientific challenge and yet harnessing that fusion
energy will be yet another grand engineering challenge on the road to fusion power production. One of
the central questions facing an IFE reactor system is whether inertial fusion targets can produce significant
energy gain, reliably, cheaply, and rapidly when integrated with the full reactor system. Ignition
experiments have shown a significant sensitivity to enhanced radiation losses induced by impurities from
the capsule shell mixing into the burning fusion fuel (mix) and implosion asymmetries because both effects
compete with fusion heating. The maximum target gain in ICF depends on a competition between fusion
heating and losses (from expansion, radiation, and conduction). It is therefore plausible that asymmetry
in the system or a sudden increase in losses due to impurities (say from mix, introduction of wetted-foam,
or high-Z cone material) could negatively affect the total gain by harming the fusion power balance. This
work will assess the impacts of asymmetry and mix, establish the role of asymmetry and mix in limiting
gain or preventing ignition for IFE systems, set IFE system requirements for managing these issues, and
forecast impacts for several IFE concepts. This work will compliment ongoing efforts in ICF while pivoting
to understand how these degradations impact IFE reactor systems by advancing the understanding of
hydrodynamic instabilities and asymmetries into the realm of IFE target design. Success in this research
will advance our capabilities in understanding the cost and performance needed for future IFE reactors.

A Planetary-Scale Data‚ÄìModel Integration Framework to Resolve Urban Impacts Across Scales and Examine Weather
Extremes over Coastal U.S. Cities
Dr. Tirthankar Chakraborty, Earth Scientist
Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change
Division Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
Urbanization leads to widespread modifications to the Earth‚Äôs land surface and directly impacts more
than half of the total global population by influencing weather and climate. These impacts are expected
to magnify in the future due to increased urbanization and greater rural-to-urban migration. Current-
generation Earth System Models (ESMs) inadequately represent urban areas and processes. They either
ignore urban land completely or treat cities like biologically inactive surfaces with discrete and crudely
specified properties. These simplified representations are insufficient for capturing variability in urban
impacts on weather and climate across global cities. The limited number of ESMs that do represent
urban areas do not account for temporal changes due to urban evolution, which is the combined result
of urban expansion and varying surface properties over time. This urban evolution will become
increasingly important in the future as the world keeps urbanizing. These issues are particularly relevant
for complex coastal‚Äìurban environments, characterized by strong land-to-water spatial gradients in
both surface and atmospheric variables. Current-generation ESMs cannot sufficiently resolve
interactions between urbanization and coastal processes, which can have potentially critical impacts on
weather and climate, especially during extreme events.
To address these model deficiencies, the proposed research aims to develop a globally consistent data‚Äì
model integration framework for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Energy Exascale Earth System Model
(E3SM) to resolve urbanization and its feedbacks to the atmosphere across multiple spatial and
temporal scales with a focus on coastal U.S. cities. To accomplish this, the E3SM Land Model will be
improved to incorporate more accurate urban characteristics and processes derived from planetary-
scale satellite imagery and satellite-derived datasets, other gridded products, and machine learning
(ML) techniques for recent past, present, and potential future scenarios. A range of urban-scale
measurements from various sources will also be compiled to create a model testbed for quantifying
uncertainties throughout the model development process. Beyond the importance of this testbed for
this project, it will be an essential resource for the wider urban climate community. Finally, a hierarchy
of E3SM simulations, both coupled and uncoupled, across scales constrained by ML algorithms will be
run to examine km-scale urban climate variability and generate groundbreaking insights regarding
coastal‚Äìurban interactions.
Overall, this work will not only develop an advanced urban parameterization for the next generation of
ESMs but will also generate tools and datasets that can better assess and advise climate adaptation and
mitigation strategies as we prepare for a warmer and more urban future.

Interpretable Deep Learning for Advancing Field-Enhanced Catalysis
Dr. Fanglin Che, Assistant Professor
Chemical Engineering, Francis College of Engineering
University of Massachusetts Lowell
Lowell, MA, 01854
Electric fields can modify the adsorption of polarized species and enhance the reaction rates and
selectivity by a few orders of magnitude. These field-enhanced chemical processes provide a sustainable,
energy-efficient, modular setup to store renewable electricity chemically. However, the high-cost of
computations for field-dipole interactions on energetics has resulted in a trial-and-error approach for
field-driven experimental processes. It is important to develop an interpretable deep learning approach
to advance an in-depth understanding of field-dipole effects and promote electrostatic catalysis.
In this research, we focus on a case study of carbon-neutral hydrogen production and utilization, e.g.,
ammonia cracking and synthesis, over earth-abundant metal catalysts. In particular, we will (1) probe the
local fields of nanoparticles under working conditions, (2) predict field-driven adsorption energetics with
an interpretable deep learning approach, and (3) discover the optimal field-dipole effects on catalysis.
Interpretable deep learning of field-dipole interaction represents a new paradigm for designing high
performance catalysis where large local field exists for renewable-energy related technologies, such as
electrostatic catalysis, electrocatalysis, and fuel cells. The fundamental science of how field-dipole
interactions has the potential to alter the energetics of ammonia cracking. In addition, synthesis of earth-
abundant-based nanoparticle catalysts with low-coordinated sites will improve the energy efficiency of
carbon-free hydrogen production, utilization, and storage.

Harnessing Quantum Geometry of Correlated Electrons for Next-Generation Photovoltaics
Dr. Martin Claassen, Assistant
Professor Department of Physics and
Astronomy University of Pennsylvania
Philadelphia, PA 19104
Understanding how light interacts with mater is foundational to tailoring optical properties and designing
next-generation photovoltaics for solar energy harvesting. To exceed the limitations of conventional
semiconductors, a key new frontier concerns harnessing the collective quantum-mechanical behavior of
electrons in correlated quantum materials, to convert light into electric current. Such materials are
governed by a fascinating but delicate interplay of spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom
arising from strong electronic interactions. However, they pose a profound theoretical challenge in
understanding their optical properties. This project will develop a novel theoretical and
computational foundation for emergent photogalvanic responses in strongly correlated quantum
materials, deeply tied to the interplay between strong electronic interactions and the quantum-
geometrical structure of the electronic wave functions which couple to light. A central goal is the
development of generic design principles for a new class of Mot bulk photovoltaics, materials that
are insulators due to strong repulsion between electrons but can efficiently rectify light into electrical
current. To this end, key objectives include predicting many- electron photovoltaic responses for
paradigmatic low-dimensional polar Mot insulators, devising quantum-geometrical guiding principles
for photogalvanic responses in correlated and topological van der Waals heterostructures, and
developing new computational tools which combine first principles modelling with many-electron
simulations to drive the discovery of new correlated photovoltaic materials. Insights gained from this
project will establish strongly correlated electron systems as a transformative new platform for
photovoltaic applications, with broader theoretical ramifications for other photon-based
spectroscopies, optical driving, and control of correlated and topological quantum materials.

Functionalization of Methane and Carbon Dioxide
Using Earth Abundant Metal Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts
Dr. Kensha Marie Clark, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
University of Mississippi
Oxford, MS 38677
The valorization of methane, a major component of fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, the
thermodynamically favored product of fossil fuel combustion, is a challenge of global proportions. These
two potent greenhouse gases are often considered waste due to their thermodynamic stability and
kinetically inert bonds which are an obstacle to their conversion into commodity chemicals. To incentivize
the capture and use of these gases as an abundant and sustainable source of chemical feedstock,
pathways that easily break their bonds and convert them into value-added products are needed. The goal
of this research is to use so-called sterically frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), which are Lewis acid-base pairs
that have unquenched acidity and basicity when combined, to develop catalytic cycles that functionalize
methane and carbon dioxide to yield industrially important commodity chemicals.
Over the course of this project, complexes containing earth abundant metals of Groups 8-13 will be paired
with bulky bases to generate FLPs that activate methane and/or carbon dioxide. This FLP reactivity will be
coupled with the inherent reactivity of the metal to generate industrially viable and environmentally
benign catalytic routes to a variety of chemicals. Specifically, catalytic cycles that convert methane to
methanol, acetic acid, and acetaldehyde, as well as those that convert CO into acrylic acid or acrylate will
2
be designed using four different ligand platforms. These systems will be optimized through
parameterization of steric and electronic factors that affect catalyst activity. Thermodynamic studies that
measure the hydricity and bond dissociation energies, in addition to kinetics experiments and
computational analyses, will be conducted to provide mechanistic insights about these systems that may
be extrapolated to design additional processes that commoditize other challenging small molecule
targets. Furthermore, these systems will be heterogenized to create economical, industrially viable, and
sustainable catalysts from earth abundant metals.

Symmetry in Quantum Field Theory
Dr. Clay C√≥rdova, Assistant
Professor Department of
Physics University of Chicago
Chicago, Illinois 60637
Symmetry is a powerful mathematical tool for organizing the diverse physical phenomena described by
quantum field theory. The unifying theme that gives symmetry its essential power is its invariance under
continuous deformations of a physical system including changes in characteristic energy scales. This
invariance provides a deep conceptual bridge between symmetry in quantum physics and topology in
mathematics. Recently, there has been explosive progress in this foundational discipline driven by the
discovery of new concepts of symmetry. These higher symmetries act on extended dynamical objects such
as strings or membranes, which often emerge as collective excitations of quantum fields. A paradigmatic
example is a tube of flux and energy connecting confined quarks.
The main aims of this project are to harness these new notions of symmetry and understand their
implications. First, this research project will explore and generalize new notions of symmetry across
myriad examples of gauge theories. This includes developing the necessary mathematical framework
which is described by topological quantum field theory. Second, the project will explore the constraints of
these novel symmetries on phases of quantum systems and strong coupling dynamics. Finally, the
reserach will apply these new symmetries to potential physics beyond the Standard Model. In this arena
the research program will investigate whether new notions of naturalness suggested by these symmetries
lead to new phenomenological models of particle physics.

Forecasting Thermoelectric Performance in 2D Metal-Organic Frameworks
Through Ab Initio Atomistic Modeling
Dr. Laura de Sousa Oliveira, Assistant Professor
Chemistry Department
University of Wyoming
Laramie, WY 82071
Thermoelectrics are a class of materials and devices that convert a temperature difference into electricity
(i.e., generate electricity), and vice-versa. To realize maximum efficiency, thermoelectrics must be
excellent electrical conductors but poor thermal conductors, two properties that are interconnected and
difficult to disentangle. Metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous coordination networks with
exceptionally large surface area and modularity. Through different combinations of property-correlated
building blocks and topology, MOFs can be tailored to myriad applications such as gas storage, sensing,
catalysis, and energy storage. Due to their porosity MOFs have extremely low thermal conductivities, a
principal requirement for thermoelectric applications. By the same token, however, in addition to being
thermal insulators, MOFs tend to be electrical insulators as well. Applications requiring electrical
conductivity, such as thermoelectrics, have thus been largely overlooked. Devices have become
increasingly efficient, thereby requiring much less power to function, and dependent on other properties
such as flexibility and added functionality. MOFs, which exhibit flexibility and additional functionality, are
ideal candidates for energy efficient thermoelectric devices. The objective of this research is to develop
the fundamental knowledge to predict how molecular structure controls electrical (and to a lesser extent
thermal) conductivity in MOFs to inform the rational design of thermoelectric MOFs. The insight gained
from the work will help guide the development of smart materials (e.g., wearable devices, biomedical
implants, portable electronics) and give rise to novel applications and devices (e.g., heat powered sensors
or catalysts).

Unraveling the Heavy Side of Radiochemistry:
A Macromolecular Approach to Unlock Novel Actinide Chemistry
Dr. Gauthier J.-P. Deblonde, Staff Scientist
Nuclear and Chemical Sciences Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
While radioisotopes such as actinides and radiolanthanides have unique physicochemical properties that
make them the cornerstones of strategic sectors‚Äîincluding, energy, medicine, space exploration,
defense, and research‚Äîonly a modest number of their compounds have been characterized to date. Such
knowledge gaps preclude comprehensive understanding of their coordination chemistry, spectroscopic,
magnetic, and electronic properties. The synthesis and characterization of metal-ligand complexes
typically provide invaluable information on the coordination chemistry and physicochemical properties of
elements across the periodic table. Problematically, studying complexes of radioelements is inherently
challenging due to radiation-related constraints and limited access to compatible research facilities.
Further compounding these challenges is a lesser-considered aspect of radiochemistry: the high cost and
low availability of the isotopes severely restrict the experimental space and chemical systems
investigated. In fact, most synthetic approaches and spectroscopic tools available today are not
compatible with highly radioactive and/or rare isotopes, in part, because these approaches and tools
require large amounts of materials, a factor that correspondingly raises costs, increases workers‚Äô
exposure, consumes precious isotope resources, and hinders such discoveries as the resolution of the f-
electron challenge. This research will use a macromolecular approach‚Äîleveraging a class of ligands called
polyoxometalates‚Äîto (a) overcome the limitations inherent to classic radiochemical techniques, (b)
unravel novel coordination chemistry for actinides, (c) leverage these novel compounds to decipher the
electronic, spectroscopic, and magnetic properties of the most critical and elusive heavy elements, and
(d) develop polyoxometalate- driven radiochemical separations. This project‚Äôs pragmatic and efficient
approach should significantly expand understandings of the chemistry of actinides as well as other
difficult-to-study radioisotopes and could open a frontier in radiochemistry impacting the isotope supply
chain‚Äîfrom the basic science of f-elements to isotope processing and separation, to novel actinide
materials.

Optimization of the nEXO detector for enhanced sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe
Dr. Maria Laura di Vacri, PhD
Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Technology Division
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99352
The experimental observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would have revolutionary implications
for neutrino physics, theories beyond the standard model, and cosmology. This work will enhance the
prospects of the next Enriched Xenon Observatory (nEXO) experiment by addressing a critical challenge
in all experimental searches for neutrinoless double beta decay: material radioactive backgrounds. The
project has three objectives. First, this research will improve the nEXO projected sensitivity on the
neutrinoless double beta decay half-life of 136Xe by ca. 20% by mitigating the most prevalent backgrounds
predicted for nEXO: impurities of 222Rn and its progeny in the detector. Second, enhanced control of
exposure-based backgrounds will be tackled through improved assay methods, with a focus on
radioactivity from dust particulate fallout on detector materials. Finally, this work will develop high-purity
Cu-based alloys with yield strength significantly larger than pure Cu. In the context of the nEXO detector,
increased strength translates into reduced production time, increased performance, and potentially
further reduced backgrounds. The nEXO experiment is a major investment in the understanding of
neutrinos. While targeted to nEXO, this work will inform the extent to which low-background experiments
can reach the greatest sensitivity through mitigation of backgrounds in materials and in the environment
into which these experiments are built.

A Captivating New Spin on Energy Storage
Dr. Leah G. Dodson, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry University of Maryland
College Park, MD 20742
Trapping, storage, and transport of fuels are central themes of current energy research, with significant
emphasis placed on improving safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Towards the goal of divestment from
petrochemicals, much research continues to focus on small gaseous molecules‚Äîmainly H and CH ‚Äîto
2 4
serve as alternative fuel sources. For practical applications of these alternative fuels to supplement or
even replace gasoline and diesel fuels, safe and effective on-board vehicular storage methods must be
realized. A promising strategy for hydrogen storage is to use adsorbent materials‚Äîlike metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs)‚Äîupon which gaseous molecules can be efficiently captured due to the material‚Äôs high
porosity. Even though significant progress has been made towards the development of advanced
materials with high-efficiency storage, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target storage goals have not
been met. Several challenges remain, most notably those related to the requisite storage pressure and
temperature falling outside of DOE target parameters. Many of these challenges are rooted in an
incomplete understanding of the fundamental chemical physics of the small gaseous molecules
themselves. For example, recent advancements show that molecules in their lowest-energy nuclear-spin
state have higher storage capacities in MOFs in scale cryogenic applications, but methods of selective
enrichment of such quantum states are currently unavailable for molecules other than H . If gaseous fuels
2
could be selectively enriched in their lowest-energy form, then combining enriched fuels and MOFs would
be a viable path toward energy storage and transport efficiency. Our new research program will produce
laboratory-scale samples of alternative fuels that have been prepared in specific nuclear-spin quantum
states via a novel method using paramagnetic MOF materials at cryogenic temperatures. Using advanced
spectroscopic methods, this research program will investigate the fundamental gas/surface interactions
to realize optimal conditions for nuclear-spin enrichment. Our research towards the precise control and
artificial enrichment of nuclear-spin isomers will reveal new underlying physics related to nuclear spins.
Achieving a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for artificial enrichment is a key step towards
optimal storage devices for alternative fuels, enabling their use for a more sustainable and green energy
future.

Understanding the Relationship between Surface Lattice Rigidity and Single Photon Emission Dynamics in Strongly
Confined Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots
Dr. Dong, Yitong, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
University of Oklahoma,
Norman, OK 73019
Cyberattacks and hacks are growing threats to the United States‚Äô national security. Such persistent risks
demand quantum information sciences that offer the possibility of ultra-secure communications. Photonic
quantum networks are promising quantum communication technologies, since photons can be
transmitted with minimal loss. To build photonic networks, single photon emitters (SPEs) are required.
Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with high luminescence efficiency at room
temperature are ideal SPE materials. Moreover, strongly confined perovskite QDs (SCPQDs), whose
physical sizes are smaller than the Bohr diameters of their excitons, are predicted to have high single
photon emission purity‚Äîthe most important characteristic of SPEs‚Äîdue to their fast biexciton Auger
recombination processes. Unfortunately, current SPEs based on individual perovskite QDs exhibit severe
stochastic emission intermittencies and unexpectedly low single-photon purity. A fundamental
understanding of the insufficient single-photon emission performance is still lacking. With a focus on
cesium lead bromide SCPQDs, this project aims to understand the relationship between surface lattice
rigidity of perovskite QDs and their single photon emission dynamics. Recent advances have shown that
the surface latices of perovskite QDs are soft and can substantially affect their excitonic behaviors. This
research will apply supramolecular matrices to tune the surface lattice rigidity of SCPQDs embedded in
them and explore the single photon emission properties of these SCPQDs, including emission rates, single
photon purity, and photon coherence. The knowledge gained in this project will advance the development
of scalable, on-demand SPEs for compact photonic devices and quantum photonic networks operating at
room temperature.

Reconnection-Driven Turbulent Cascade in Magnetized Collisional and Collisionless Plasmas
Dr. Chuanfei Dong, Assistant Professor
Department of Astronomy
Boston University
Boston, MA 02215
Understanding the transfer of energy across scales in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic plasma
turbulence is crucial for tackling many outstanding space and astrophysical problems, such as solar and
stellar coronal heating, star formation, and cosmic-ray transport. For more than half a century, it has been
widely accepted that the energy cascade in turbulent plasmas such as the Sun's atmosphere is controlled
by magnetohydrodynamic wave interactions. However, one essential feature of plasma turbulence is the
ubiquitous presence of sheets of intense electric current (known as current sheets), which are preferential
locations for rapid breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines, a fundamental physical process in
magnetized plasmas whereby stored magnetic energy is converted into heat and kinetic energy of charged
particles. Recent analytic and numerical studies suggest that magnetic reconnection may facilitate the
turbulent energy cascade from large to small scales when the magnetic reconnection process becomes
fast enough compared with the nonlinear eddy turnover time scale. It is yet an open question whether
magnetic reconnection can significantly change the transfer of energy in both MHD and kinetic scales in a
wide variety of plasma systems. This project aims to investigate the interplay between magnetic
reconnection and turbulence, and the associated heating and particle acceleration in both resistive MHD
and collisionless kinetic regimes. The proposed research combines state-of-the-art numerical simulations
and theoretical analysis to explore the frontier of the interplay between turbulence and magnetic
reconnection in the regime where the tearing instability plays an important role. This new regime could
have profound implications on how energy at large-scale cascades down to small-scale and eventually
converts into thermal and nonthermal energy of particles.

Steel is a pillar of modern society and our sustainable energy future, as it is the go-to alloy for robust,
reliable, and customizable conditions. However, steelmaking accounts for 8% of global CO emissions.
2
Over half those emissions occur as Fe is separated from O in iron ores: hematite (Fe O ) to iron (Fe).
2 3
Established blast-furnaces use coal as a reductant producing 1.5 molecules of CO per Fe. Hydrogen direct
2
reduction (HyDR) of iron ores generates H O byproduct at lower reaction temperatures. While promising,
2
scaling HyDR‚Äôs endothermic kinetics and mass-transport limited solid-gas mechanism has been slow due
to poorly understood fundamental science. Longstanding questions as to how to understand and control
competing mechanisms and thermochemically limited mass transport in the defected and impure
minerals still hinder commercial viability for the >100 megaton/yr throughput required to match blast
furnaces. Iron ore ‚Äúfines‚Äù produced industrially are nanoparticles that react differently from bulk materials
due to their larger surface-to-volume ratios. This project explores how the nanograins native to iron ore
fines dictate the chemistry that has previously been overlooked. Using advanced spectroscopy and
imaging techniques, this work studies how distortions in the energy landscape caused by the
nanoconfinement offer opportunities for enhanced mechanistic control. The fundamental science from
our project will provide key insights into strategies to efficiently drive Fe‚ÄîO separations in iron oxide ores
to help decarbonize this critical technology.

Phase-space engineering of supra-thermal particle distribution for optimizing burning plasma

Princeton, NJ 08540
This five-year project aims to design, validate and optimize the multiscale physics of self-consistent and
numerically efficient reduced models of fast ion transport within whole device modeling with
simultaneous radio frequency and neutral beam injection heating. Research activities include
comprehensive exploration studies to engineer ways of minimizing energetic particle transport in order
to maximize core fusion performance, using tools that build on recent developments in fundamental
nonlinear kinetic theory and their associated numerical implementations. This proposal aims at leveraging
those recent advances into practical macro-stability ramifications in NSTX-U and DIII-D, and high-fidelity
transport projections to burning plasma conditions, such as those expected in ITER. The control and
avoidance of energetic particle-driven magnetohydrodynamic instabilities are essential ingredients for
achieving burning plasmas relevant to economical, high gain fusion reactors. Although ITER will employ
comparable amounts of radio frequency and neutral beam injected heating power, the energetic particle
transport under such a combined scenario still remains poorly understood. The overarching goal of this
project is to deliver and exploit a validated, fully predictive and integrated fast ion transport workflow,
accounting for both radio frequency and neutral beam injection heating sources, collisions and Alfv√©nic
eigenmodes in different regimes of instability excitation. This project aims at delivering concrete solutions
for integrated scenarios currently being studied in preparation for burning plasmas. Physical insights will
be actively pursued to divert and mitigate deleterious fast ion phase space flows in NSTX-U, DIII-D, and
ITER while simultaneously ensuring compatibility with macroscopic performance constraints. The
successful demonstration of the proposed quantitative prediction of fast ion transport and combined
neutral beam injection and radio frequency scenario development will potentially help to close the
energetic particle gap for ITER burning plasmas.

Hierarchical Assembly of Biomimetic Active Mater Driven by Non-Equilibrium Actin Turnover
Dr. Guillaume Duclos, Assistant
Professor Department of
Physics Brandeis University
Waltham, MA 02453
Living organisms display many enticing features that, if embedded within synthetic materials, would have
transformative applications in the fields of material science and energy. Cells are composed of molecular
machines and energy-consuming polymers that produce mechanical work at the protein scale, leading to
spectacular emergent behaviors at the macroscopic scale, such as spontaneous motility, replication, self-
healing, and morphogenesis. However, the rational design and control of programmable materials that
robustly mimic these features are still in their infancy. This proposal‚Äôs goal is to elucidate how energy-
consuming proteins work coherently over multiple length scales to generate complex, yet organized,
structures and motion. Specifically, we will establish a new in vitro model system where coupling between
reaction/diffusion-mediated pattern formation and polymerization of actin filaments mimics fundamental
features of morphogenesis. This work will set the fundamental design rules for building low-energy
multiscale materials that can autonomously accomplish tasks greater than the sum of their parts. The
resulting machines will be less prone to catastrophic failure due to the distributed and hierarchical
mechanisms that drive their motion.
We propose a synergistic experimental/modeling approach that combines biochemistry, soft mater
physics, mathematics, and machine learning. Micron-scale beads covered with an actin nucleating protein
self-propel when immersed in a solution of actin monomers and actin-binding proteins, mimicking the
motility of small parasites such as listeria. One overarching goal is to investigate how emergent behaviors
propagate across multiple length scales. A variety of emergent behaviors will be investigated at the single
bead length scale, between pairs of beads, in dense colloidal suspensions, and in three dimensional
polymeric materials composed of treadmilling actin filaments.
With our growing demand for alternative energy sources, efficient low-energy materials that harness
chemical energy from their environment to produce programmable and controllable flow patterns are a
highly sought-after goal in soft robotics, bioengineering, and materials sciences. This project will establish
fundamental design rules for creating multiscale materials endowed with life-like properties. The resulting
machines will be less prone to catastrophic failure due to the distributed and hierarchical mechanisms
that drive their motion.

Multi-Linear Representations for Quantum Characterization, Control, and Computation
Dr. Eugene Dumitrescu, Research Scientist
Computational Science and Engineering

Oak Ridge, TN 37831
What quantum mechanical problems can be solved efficiently with future generations of classical
computers? What are the fundamental scaling limits of characterizing and controlling quantum devices
and their computing architectures? Current approaches to answering these intertwined questions are
limited by either oversimplified noise models or unsustainable classical compute requirements. This
research program simultaneously addresses both these challenges by developing memory-efficient
algorithms based on the multi-linear representation (MLRep) theory of low-rank linear operators for
quantum characterization, control, and computation. To maximize the scale at which realistic semi-
coherent quantum device dynamics can be modeled with classical computational resources, we first
develop scalable MLRep algorithms factorizing a low-rank quantum state‚Äôs coherent and incoherent
correlations. The developed MLRep algorithms will subsequently be integrated into a characterization
workflow scaling the construction of empirical error bounds with respect to select quantum processes.
The characterization framework will assess the quantum processes‚Äô quality as well as demonstrate the
feasibility of MLRep-mediated quantum control. Finally, with the goal of accelerating computational
science, the project‚Äôs MLRep algorithms will be compiled into a new linear algebra package gauging
classical high-performance computing resources‚Äô ultimate potential in quantum control and
computation.

Mapping the space-time evolution of quarks and gluons at RHIC

Vanderbilt University
Nashville, Tennessee 37240
Fundamental building blocks of the observable universe, quarks and gluons, can be studied in
relativistic collider experiments as energetic interactions liberate and produce particles which are
observed by state-of-the-art particle detectors. One of the biggest unsolved mysteries in nature is in
quantifying the mechanism by which quarks/gluons metamorphosize into stable particles such as
protons and other
hadrons that make up what we see all around us. Such a transition encodes critical features of the
theory of strong interaction i.e., quantum chromodynamics (QCD), one of the four fundamental forces.
Our group will study relativistic collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) with the new sPHENIX detector that has just started taking data for the first
time in 2023. Heavy ion collisions are a perfect laboratory to study the properties of the early universe
as they recreate conditions, high temperature and energy densities, supposed to have existed a few
micro- seconds after the big bang. Jets, collections of particles resulting from the fragmentation of
highly energetic quarks/gluons, have the right time-scale for probing these conditions.
Our results will enable an extraction of the dynamics of quarks/gluons for the first time in high
energy nuclear physics. These results satisfy the mission critical need and success of a central goal of
BNL and RHIC‚Äôs nuclear physics program ‚Äì studying the production, evolution and eventual demise of
the emergent Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and its microscopic transport properties.

Particle accelerators have been the leading tool for fundamental discovery science and high energy
physics for more than a century. Progress in society‚Äôs understanding of the fundamental interactions of
Nature has been predicated by advances in accelerator technology and associated improvements in the
particle beams they generate. To continue probing the natural world with greater precision, the next
generation of accelerators will need to produce higher intensity particle beams with extreme properties
beyond the current state of the art. The research carried out in this project will produce the extremely
bright and intense electron beams needed to serve the next generation of high energy physics and
fundamental science experiments. These beams will enable us to conduct experiments that will shed light
on open questions in fundamental quantum physics, astrophysics, and the design of future particle
colliders. Concurrently, these beams will broadly benefit society by enabling the study of important ultra-

required to drive these future experiments, leveraging the expertise across SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, and taking advantage of a suitable user facility, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator
Experimental Tests (FACET-II), which can both host the experiments and whose scientific program can

Demonstrating enabling technologies for a spectroscopy instrument for the next cosmic survey
Dr. Guillermo Fernandez Moroni, Associate
Scientist Particle Physics Division
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
Understanding the physical processes responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe is one of
the most important questions in physics. In the last decades, there has been tremendous progress in our
understanding of how dark energy dominates its expansion in later times. However, the mechanisms
driving the expansion in its earliest moments have been less explored. Those marks from the early
universe are imprinted in the distribution of mater at large scales in current times. To observe those
features, extensive surveys mapping the three-dimensional distribution of the galaxies in the universe
should be conducted. The scientific community is pursuing the construction of the next-generation
spectroscopic facility for that purpose, which should provide at least an order of magnitude increase in
observational power compared to the current experiments. This project aims to demonstrate the
technology for constructing such a large spectroscopy instrument. The program will be centered on
increasing the survey speed and science reach over existing equipment. It will be focused on the
development and characterization of miniaturized robotic fiber positioners to increase the number of
accessible targets per telescope light-collecting area and the development of sensor technologies that
maximize the detection efficiency of the distinctive features in the photon spectrum needed to map galaxy
motion. Very sensitive optical silicon imagers, which provide single photon counting capability, will be
used for the later. In the final stage of the project, the construction of a small-scale instrument for a sky
demonstration will be evaluated based on the readiness of these technologies.

Probing Water Cycle Processes and Extremes in Coastal and Urban Environments Using Water Isotope
Ratio Tracers and Numerical Tags
Dr. Rich Fiorella, Staff Scientist
Earth and Environmental Sciences Division
Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos, NM 87544
Coasts represent some of the most dynamic and complex natural systems on Earth and are of outsized
importance, relative to their area, for national and global economies. Nearly half of the global
population lives within 100km of a coast and up to 90% of the world‚Äôs international trade passes
through coastal infrastructure. Coastal zones sit at the nexus of societal and environmental challenges:
urbanization of coastal regions is expected to continue while risks from extreme events, sea level rise,
ground water salinization, and coastal erosion are increasing due to climate change. These intersecting
challenges motivate a need for Earth system models (ESMs) that can represent coastal systems in detail
to better understand risk to and resilience of coastal cities arising from climate change and increased
urbanization.
Recent advancements in computational capability have enabled new ways of representing coastal
systems in ESMs, such as the Department of Energy‚Äôs Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). While
improvements have been made to parameterization and representation of coastal processes, the impacts
of these changes can be hard to assess at a process level. Furthermore, urban systems remain at the sub-
grid scale for all but the highest resolution configurations of ESMs and therefore are highly
parameterized. These limitations prevent a detailed understanding of coastal processes, their interactions
with coastal cities, and the individual hydrologic processes that drive responses to extreme events or
determine the success or failure of proposed mitigation and adaptation interventions.
This project will address these limitations by developing a comprehensive water tracking system
throughout E3SM. This tracking system will also provide capability to simulate water isotope ratios,
which are a commonly used tracer of hydrological processes. Existing water isotope ratio observations
will be compiled to validate the E3SM water isotope and tracer capability. Next the new water tracer
capability will be used to investigate the representation of coasts and their response to urbanization
and extreme events in E3SM. The new water tracer capability will provide new ways to compare model
simulations with tracer observations and enhance confidence in coastal and urban process
representation in E3SM. The proposed research activities would enhance the E3SM's capability to track
water sources, sinks, and transport throughout the hydrological cycle and across model components,
ultimately improving our understanding of urban-coastal system interactions. By connecting this new
tracking system to the existing capabilities, the enhanced E3SM can be utilized to study coastal change,
extreme event susceptibility, and urbanization impacts on precipitation and flooding, and potential
solutions for increasing coastal city resilience. E3SM simulations will be conducted in both in idealized
coastal-urban settings, as well as a case study of Houston, TX using data from the TRACER ARM
campaign. The new framework has enormous potential to advance our understanding of the
hydrological cycle in both natural and urbanized coastal systems and enable E3SM to answer a broad
set of coastal-urban questions.

The Development of a Real-Time Accountancy Open Framework for Fusion Energy
Dr. Holly B. Flynn, Senior Scientist
Tritium Technology Division
Savannah River National
Laboratory Aiken, SC 29808
Fusion Energy, generated by atoms fusing together versus splitting apart, is what powers our sun and the
stars. It is widely considered the commercial energy source of the future for its potential to produce
immense power, while generating no long-lived radioactive waste or greenhouse gas emissions.
Commercializing Fusion Energy has become increasingly attractive in recent years, with national
laboratories and universities partnering with private companies to make it a reality. Deuterium and tritium
(DT), isotopes of hydrogen, are the most promising fuels for commercial production of energy from fusion.
In this process, DT must be continuously supplied to the fusion reaction, ensuring that the power output
is consistent. DT is supplied to the fusion reaction by the fusion fuel cycle, a series of components that
clean-up reaction chamber exhaust and recycle DT to be re-fed as fuel. However, tritium is a radioactive
material that requires special treatment and, therefore, a commercial fusion fuel cycle must have complex
systems for extracting, moving, processing, and collecting this isotope. Because it is a critical material in
the system and because it is radioactive, tritium needs to be accurately accounted for inside the fuel cycle
to monitor inventory in different parts of the system as well as transport into and out of the plant. The
amount of tritium in the system can be monitored using a method known as batch processing, but this
requires outages or planned interruptions to fusion operations. Fusion energy plants must operate the
complex fuel cycle continuously but, to date, there is no known method of monitoring tritium levels within
an acceptable accuracy range of less than 1% under continuous operating conditions. Furthermore,
accountancy techniques need to consider losses of tritium from burn-up and permeation into and through
materials involved in the process; tritium gains through the production of tritium using fusion neutrons
(breeding); and measurement noise that accumulates in sensors during operation. This research will
couple machine learning methods currently used in self-driving cars and radar tracking with physical
measurements of tritium in the fuel cycle to develop a framework for real-time accountancy of tritium
gain and loss. The machine learning algorithms, known as Bayesian prediction algorithms, take
information from a virtual computational model of the fusion test system, and data from the tritium
measurement sensors, to provide an integrated visualization of tritium inventory with incredible accuracy.
The successful development of real-time accounting of tritium levels (an ‚Äúaccountancy open framework‚Äù)
during fusion operation is critical to the success and efficient operation of commercial Fusion Energy.

Probing Correlated Phenomena in Graphene Constrictions
Dr. Fereshte Ghahari Kermani, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy
George Mason University
Fairfax, VA 22030
Understanding the quantum electronic properties of charge carriers in nanostructures can have significant
implications for the advancement of future quantum technologies. This research focuses on designing and
engineering clean and tunable graphene-based nano constrictions and probing correlated phases in these
artificial potential landscapes. This is an underexplored area in two-dimensional material research,
primarily due to technical difficulties related to disorder and the lack of control over the confinement
potentials. These challenges will be addressed by integrating clean van der Waals heterostructures having
gate tunable electronic phases with scanning probe microscopy (SPM)-based nanolithography techniques.
This will enable nanoscale electrostatic control with contaminant-free interfaces, thereby creating high
quality and tunable constrictions. The quantum electronic properties of these structures will be
investigated by employing different measurement techniques, including transport and advanced SPM, and
tuning experimental knobs such as temperature, electric and magnetic fields. These studies aim to
understand the interaction effects in the transport of Dirac electrons through narrow 1D channels and
explore the quantized supercurrent in superconducting quantum point contacts formed within graphene-
based moir√© systems, where distinct quantum phases can be switched on and off electrostatically in a
single material. Furthermore, this investigation will characterize the charge and statistics of emergent
quasiparticles of fractional quantum Hall states and examine their potential manipulation and braiding by
local probes. The outcomes of this project will have important implications for the development of novel
quantum devices and the advancement of quantum information technologies.

Unraveling Ultrafast Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules
Dr. Nikolay Golubev, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Arizona
Tucson, AZ 85721
Photoinduced molecular processes play a key role in physics, chemistry, and biology. In nature, light
triggers a large variety of chemical reactions such as photosynthesis, vision, and the formation of vitamin
D, but also can cause undesirable radiation damage. Furthermore, the interaction of light with mater
forms the basis of important technological applications such as solar cells in which photoinduced charge
transfer and light harvesting are essential. What all these processes have in common is capturing the
energy of light and its transformation into other forms of energy like heat, electricity, or chemical energy.
On a microscopic level, the energy conversion processes result from correlated motion of electrons and
nuclei after photoexcitation or photoionization of a molecule. Although much has been achieved in the
understanding of fundamental physics underlying the electron-nuclear interactions and dynamics, the
accurate numerical simulation of light-induced processes taking place in realistic polyatomic molecules
remains an unsolved problem. The objective of this research is to develop both exact and approximate
computationally efficient quantum dynamics methods capable of simulating the light-driven electron-
nuclear dynamics in polyatomic molecules that account for non-adiabatic effects and include multiple
electronic states. While the main focus is method development, all new methods are applied to describe
properties and behavior of systems of physical, chemical, and biological interest, interpret recent
experimental measurements, and guide future experimental efforts.

Using Ancient Enzymes for Modern Photosynthesis
Dr. Laura Gunn, Assistant Professor
School of Integrative Plant Sciences, Plant Biology
Section Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14853
Nature‚Äôs CO -fixing enzyme Ribulose-1,5-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) has a slow catalytic rate and
2
exhibits poor substrate specificity, such that Rubisco catalysis often limits the rate of photosynthetic
carbon assimilation and thus the growth and yield of crop species. Rubisco‚Äôs catalytic limitations are
exacerbated under high temperature, which is especially concerning because the average global
temperature is projected to increase roughly 5.7¬∞C by the year 2100. A previous study used a
computational ‚Äútime machine‚Äù to reconstruct ancestral Rubisco sequences that operated under higher
CO and temperatures approximately 25 million years ago. Each of these reconstructed enzymes have
2
several amino acid substitutions relative to modern day tobacco Rubisco, and some of them exhibit
improved catalysis and thermostability. To understand the mechanism by which these substitutions
influence Rubisco activity and thermal stability, new Rubisco mutants will be created containing different
combinations of the amino acid substitutions found in the top performing reconstructed Rubiscos. These
new Rubisco variants will be produced in an E. coli synthetic biology expression system, and their kinetic
profile thoroughly probed to pinpoint which aspect(s) of the CO - reduction chemistry are modified at
2
different temperatures by the amino acid substitutions. How these mutations confer enhanced
thermostability to Rubisco will also be computationally predicted and experimentally validated. To
demonstrate that these ancestral Rubiscos improve plant growth under different, including projected
future, CO concentrations and temperatures, the performance of reconstructed and new Rubisco variants
2
inside plants will be mathematically modeled across different CO pressures and temperatures. Top
2
performing variants from the modelling will be expressed in tobacco plants and their growth,
photosynthetic efficiency, and Rubisco kinetics evaluated under different environmental conditions. This
research will provide fundamental insights into how changing the enzymatic environment can enhance
the efficiency of biological carbon capture.

Nature-Derived Materials for Redox Flow Batteries
Dr. Shabnam Hematian, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
University of North Carolina at Greensboro
Greensboro, NC 27402
Redox flow batteries are a promising technology in the search to find efficient large-scale storage options
for the electricity generated by intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or
hydropower. The battery consists of negative (i.e., anolyte) and positive (i.e., catholyte) electrolytes
separated by an ionically-conducting membrane. The charging/discharging efficiency and the amount of
energy stored in a redox flow battery depends on the properties of the electrolytes. Wide-scale utilization
of this technology has been limited by the availability and cost of electrolyte materials as well as loss of
capacity over time, particularly those focused on metal-based redox species. Organic redox flow batteries
are promising alternatives due to their high structural diversity and synthetic tunability. In this project, we
take inspiration from Nature by utilizing fungal or plant perylenequinones (PQs) that can be
biosynthesized via fermentation or in vitro cultures in our energy storage research to improve the
efficiency and storage capacity of redox flow batteries.
Using the redox active PQs to create new electrolyte materials enables reactions with a higher number of
electrons (i.e., higher charge) as anolyte, catholyte, or both in a symmetric flow battery. In addition to
being more efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable, the same electrolyte material can be used
in both positive and negative components of the battery avoiding cross-contamination and offering
promising features for large-scale stationary energy storage applications such as low cost, an easy
manufacturing process, greater stability, and simple recycling post-process. Pushing the boundaries of
what can be accomplished with these Nature-optimized molecules, we will determine their performance
in a membrane-free setup with two immiscible redox electrolytes. This approach will present the first
example of a true symmetric biphasic redox flow battery.

Room Temperature Stabilization of Ordered 2D Charge Density Waves in Atomically Thin Materials
Dr. Robert Hovden, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
In crystals, charge density waves are a spontaneous rearrangement of electrons that mediate metal-
insulator transitions, compete with superconductivity, and demonstrate ultrafast non-volatile switching.
Room temperature access to ordered two-dimensional charge density waves would provide next
generation computing that is a paradigm shift toward energy efficient computing, low-voltage logic, and
quantum-based devices. This research will investigate novel quantum phase of mater, where low-
temperature charge density waves are stabilized at room temperature through out-of-plane charge
twinning in confined atomic layers. Moreover, at higher temperatures, ordered states emerge, suggesting
fragile quantum states can be enhanced. Discovery and synthesis of novel charge density waves requires
high-resolution scanning / transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) where the picoscale, nanoscale, and
microscale structure can be measured directly. This research will control emergent charge ordered phases
and unveil the mechanics of transformation using in-situ S/TEM with electrical and temperature
measurement on nanostructured devices.

Fourier and Fractional Neural Operators to Unveil Topological Textures in 3D Magnetism
Dr. Ezio Iacocca, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Energy
Science University of Colorado Colorado
Springs Colorado Springs, CO 80918
The ever-increasing demand for data storage and computation has spawned the search for
unconventional computing schemes. To achieve the needed paradigm shift in technology, functional
materials hosting information-carrying objects must be identified. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic
textures are promising candidates as information-carrying objects because of their expected robustness
to perturbations, quantified by a topological index, and manipulation by electrical means. However,
interesting 3D topological textures have not been possible to create or manipulate on demand. The
objective of this research is to discover magnetic materials where 3D topological magnetic textures can
be created and manipulated by implementing novel machine-learning algorithms. For this, it is
fundamental to define new models of magnetism that can describe both atomic-scale interactions that
resolve topological defects, and long-range interactions that resolve the object‚Äôs profile and coupling to
the environment. In other words, a new description of the fundamental physics and manipulation by
electrical means on equal footing utilizing analytical and computational methods is needed. Two models
based on Fourier transform and fractional calculus will be introduced. These models will set a physics-
informed basis for novel machine learning algorithms and provide a physical definition of the prediction
error to inform their plausibility. This research aligns with DOE‚Äôs mission by introducing new theories and
computational methods for the discovery of materials with tailored and remarkable properties,
specifically for energy- efficient manipulation of information.

Quasi-Tretiz methods for problems governed by vector-valued Partial Differential equation
Dr. Lise-Marie Imbert-Gerard, Associate Professor
Department of Mathematics
Arizona Board of Regents, University of Arizona
Tucson, Arizona 85721
This project is concerned with the development of high-performance, efficient and robust techniques for
the numerical simulation of complex physical phenomena governed by vector-valued variable-
coefficient equations in three dimensions. On the one hand it includes advanced computational
methods for problems in strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. On the other hand it includes
applications to plasma physics and aeroacoustics. For instance, in the field of waves in plasmas,
inhomogeneity comes into play in a non-uniform plasma ‚Äì when its density is not constant ‚Äì while
anisotropy comes into play in a magnetized plasma ‚Äì in the presence of an equilibrium magnetic field
causing the plasma properties to vary depending on the direction considered.
The computational methods under consideration are called quasi-Tretiz methods. Tretiz methods are
seeing a renewed interest in the scientific community as various techniques have recently been
explored to tame an important issue of numerical methods based on wave-like basis functions, the well-
documented issue of conditioning. Like them, quasi-Tretiz methods rely on local problem- dependent
basis functions. However, unlike Tretiz basis functions, their basis functions are not exact solutions of
the governing equation. They were precisely introduced to leverage the benefits of Tretiz methods
while tackling problems governed by variable-coefficient equations, since exact Tretiz basis functions do
not exist in general for such problems. This project will develop quasi- Tretiz methods for vector-valued
equations in three spatial dimensions, both from the theoretical point of view and from the practical
point of view.
The expected outcome of the project is improved simulation capabilities for electromagnetic wave
propagation, in terms of
‚Ä¢ performance of numerical methods, including high-order accuracy, scalability, and efficiency,
‚Ä¢ robustness in regimes including high contrast, high anisotropy, and high frequency,
‚Ä¢ complexity of mathematical models.
Beyond wave-propagation, the development and implementation of high performance quasi-Tretiz
methods also represents a significant step towards broadening the domain of application of Tretiz
methods in general, as (1) they do not require the knowledge of explicit solutions to the governing
equations, and (2) they allow for more flexibility in the choice of basis functions.
In addition, the proposed work will lead to new scientific contributions at the interface between
the fields of mathematics and plasma physics.

Generalized Electronic Coarse-Graining for the Hierarchical Design of Organic Neuromorphics
Dr. Nicholas Jackson, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Urbana, IL 61801
Neuromorphic computing devices that mimic the neuronal and synaptic functionality of biological
organisms have the potential to transform modern computing by overcoming the energy intensive von
Neumann computing paradigm. A leading materials class for neuromorphic computing devices is organic
materials capable of sustaining simultaneous electron and ion transport, but structure-function
relationships for these materials are absent due to the hierarchical couplings between length scales that
dictate performance. While molecular modeling approaches to neuromorphic materials design hold the
potential to elucidate materials design rules, such approaches are inhibited by the prohibitive
computational cost necessary to perform quantum mechanical calculations at the required length scales
(~10-100 nm). This work will introduce a coarse-graining method that leverages machine learning to
enable chemically transferable quantum mechanical predictions at ~10-100 nm, facilitating the systematic
and hierarchical design of organic neuromorphic computing materials capable of transforming the
modern computing infrastructure.

Towards Intelligent Scheduling for Adaptive Scientific Computing with Heterogeneity
Dr. Jing Li, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
New Jersey Institute of
Technology Newark, NJ 07102
In order to keep up with trends in computer architecture and software, high-performance
computing (HPC) must adapt to heterogeneity, extreme scale, and dynamism. The complexity of HPC
systems is increasing as hardware vendors strive to improve computing capability while managing power
consumption. To achieve high performance and throughput, scientific computing applications must be
able to fully leverage these large-scale and heterogeneous resources. Meanwhile, scientific simulation and
analysis workflows are also becoming more complex and dynamic, incorporating components with varying
execution times and resource requirements. Traditional bulk-synchronous execution models are no longer
sufficient to capture these patterns. Manual resource allocation decisions require significant time and
effort from application developers in order to understand their workload and computing resources. Even
with a good understanding, deciding how to allocate resources remains highly challenging. Manual and
heuristic-based decisions often result in the under-utilization of resources and inadequate performance.
This project aims to develop an intelligent scheduling framework that can automate resource allocation
and deliver better performance for adaptive scientific workflows on HPC systems. Specifically, we will
design a tree-search-based approach to find high-quality resource allocations for specific workflows and
distill the knowledge in the trees into a policy. We will devise deep learning-based surrogate models for
fast evaluation of the quality of allocations sampled by the trees, without actually executing the scientific
workflows on HPC systems for each and every allocation. To further enhance the accuracy of the surrogate
model and the performance of the distilled policy, we will adopt active learning strategies to guide the
acquisition and usage of additional real execution data. The developed techniques in this project will have
a direct impact on HPC systems, improving resource efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and
lowering overall operating costs.

Selective Photochemical Reactions for the Discovery of Triplet Photosensitizers
Dr. Julia Kalow, Assistant
Professor Department of
Chemistry Northwestern
University Evanston, IL 60201
The evolving demands of the modern world call for new materials with advanced performance and
minimal environmental footprint. However, the prevailing one-at-a-time approach to synthesis and
testing creates a significant bottleneck for experimental validation and discovery, even when automated.
Triplet photosensitizers, light-harvesting molecules with long-lived excited states, can couple
photoexcitation to chemical reactivity for solar energy conversion. It is challenging to design triplet
photosensitizers composed solely of light elements, and many of the techniques used to measure key
properties are not amenable to high-throughput experimentation. The objective of this project is to
bypass design by directly identifying photosensitizer candidates from libraries of chromophores on the
basis of their light-induced reactivity. Selective photochemical reactions that ‚Äútag‚Äù triplet photosensitizers
will be combined with high-throughput techniques to isolate and analyze the resulting products. This
experimental platform will be guided by data science and has the potential to reveal non-intuitive
structure-property relationships. The resulting photosensitizers will be applied to the solar-fueled
deconstruction and upcycling of commodity plastic waste.

REASON-3D: Randomized, Entropic, Adaptive, and Scalable Optimization for Non-Intrusive Data-Driven Design
Dr. Brendan Keith, Assistant Professor
Division of Applied Mathematics
Brown University
Providence, Rhode Island 02912
Global transitions in energy, economy, and national security have accelerated the need for a new state-
of-the-art in robust and efficient optimal design and decision-making technology. The randomized,
entropic, adaptive, and scalable optimization for non-intrusive data-driven design (REASON-3D) project
aims to deliver on this requisite advancement in an intensive, multi-faceted, five-year research
initiative targeting, among others, adaptive, adjoint-free PDE-constrained optimization with provably
mesh- independent, high-order, risk-averse optimal design, and optimization of long-time quantities of
interest from chaotic systems. The cross-cutting theme is to harness new paradigms in variational and
probabilistic analysis to propel research and innovation into critical mission areas.
The overall goal of REASON-3D is to reach a new pinnacle in extreme-scale computational science and
engineering through entropic, randomized, adaptive, adjoint-free, and massively-scalable algorithms for
design, prediction, and decision-making. Moreover, the project aims to deliver new adaptive algorithms
for scalable, risk-averse, data-driven engineering design applications, contribute to established software
libraries, and enable extensible next-generation workflows to maximize impact and facilitate broad
adoption at domestic research institutions.
REASON-3D will advance multiple new synergistic optimization and simulation paradigms to achieve
its overall goal.
1. The project will leverage a new non-intrusive randomized differentiable programming (RDP)
paradigm to enable the solution of mission-critical scientific computing problems where traditional
differentiable programming methods are impractical or unstable. The key idea here is to compute non-
local stochastic gradients instead of local deterministic gradients.
2. The project will exploit a state-of-the-art advancement in entropy regularization methods to
geometrically mollify non-smooth objective functions and pointwise bound constraints in Sobolev
spaces. In turn, REASON-3D will deliver not only new optimization algorithms but also a new finite
element methodology that we intend to use to target invariant domain-preserving hyperbolic
flow simulations.
3. The project will deliver scalable, adaptive sampling strategies for randomized differentiable
programming and entropy regularization that leverage existing DOE software infrastructure, e.g.,
the rapid optimization library (ROL) and the modular finite element methods (MFEM) library.

Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Silicon Carbide for Fusion Applications
Dr. Takaaki Koyanagi, Research & Development Staff
Materials Science and Technology Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37831
Enabling future fusion power plants requires manufacturing advanced materials for high-performance
components and structures. Rapidly evolving additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides
flexibilities in geometries, unique material microstructures, and quality control to satisfy fusion
application needs. Silicon carbide (SiC) shows significant promise for fusion applications because of its
ability to operate at high-temperature and with a range of coolants, opening the way for high-energy
conversion efficiency. A current scientific challenge is that the fusion operating environment necessitates
demanding performance requirements for resistance to high-energy, fusion neutron irradiation. The aim
of this research is to develop a mechanistic framework for AM of highly radiation resistant SiC. This
research uses binder jet printing of SiC powders in combination with chemical vapor infiltration of SiC, a
novel process developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The neutron irradiation experiments
of traditionally fabricated SiC materials relevant to AM processing will identify radiation tolerant
microstructures. Tailoring microstructure of AM SiC will be explored based on machine learning-based
analysis on the relationship between the AM processing parameters and the resultant microstructure.
This research leverages the ORNL unique capabilities for irradiation experiments, characterizing neutron-
irradiated materials, and AM processing equipment dedicated to SiC materials. This research will support
prototyping and component testing under a future fusion technology program essential for enabling
fusion energy systems.

Selective Nucleation of Rare Earth Element Phases on Mineral Surfaces
Dr. Benjamin A. Legg, Chemist
Physical Sciences Division
Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99352
Mineral surfaces can exert profound control over the geological distribution of elements, thanks in large
part to their ability to catalyze precipitation processes such as crystal nucleation and growth. There is a
growing body of evidence that common mineral surfaces can bias precipitation pathways toward non-
classical processes and stabilize novel surface-specific phases that would not be predicted from bulk
equilibrium. This project will elucidate the molecular-scale factors that influence precipitation pathways
on mineral surfaces, in order to better understand how they influence the geological distribution of critical
elements. The study will focus specifically on the rare earth elements (REEs), which are critical materials
for clean energy technology.
A key aim of this project is to understand how factors such as surface charge, ion correlations, and
interfacial solution structure influence the mechanisms of mineral surface precipitation. The REEs will
provide an ideal case study for understanding these processes, because they display systematic variations
in key parameters such as ionic radius, solubility, hydrolysis, and points of zero charge, that can be
leveraged to elucidate the underlying physical controls. By comparing the precipitation pathways for
representative ‚Äòlight‚Äô and ‚Äòheavy‚Äô REE phases, this research will reveal how couplings between the physical
properties of the mineral surface and the precipitate (such as electrostatic charge and epitaxial lattice
match) can select between precipitation pathways. This will be achieved by using a combination of
advanced experimental and theoretical tools. The precipitation of REE surface phases will be tracked with
atomic resolution by applying in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron
microscopy, and the precipitate composition will be characterized using surface sensitive infrared
spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray adsorption methods. Complementarily three-dimensional AFM tools
will be applied to map the local electrostatic fields and solution structure of the interface, to determine
their stabilizing influence. The surface phases will be modeled using a combination of charge frustrated
lattice gas simulations and molecular dynamics simulations. The results will reveal whether common
mineral surfaces such as aluminum oxyhydroxide and phyllosilicate surfaces can drive distinct
precipitation outcomes, and test whether the resulting precipitates show element-specific selectivity that
can be leveraged to drive the separation or enrichment of REEs. This research will produce fundamental
knowledge on the molecular-scale mechanisms of REE precipitation, and mineral precipitation in general.
This knowledge will help to better describe the geochemical behavior of REEs and facilitate the
identification of novel REE ores and the development of improved recovery schemes with lower
environmental impact.

Model Reduction by Deep Learning: Interpretability and Mathematical Advances
Dr. Wenjing Liao, Assistant Professor
School of Mathematics
Georgia Institute of Technology
Atlanta, GA 30332
Many real-world applications in science and engineering involve large-scale, complex, and expensive
data simulations and inversions of physical processes. Model reduction plays a significant role in these
applications, which allows one to reduce the data dimension and the size of the problem. Classical
projection-based linear model reduction methods have demonstrated great success when the
underlying model is linear and low-dimensional. However, a large number of objects in applications
exhibit low- dimensional nonlinear structures, and many physical processes are nonlinear. The success
of model reduction crucially depends on a good discovery of the latent structures in nonlinear models.
In the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized several fields, and neural networks have been
introduced to data simulations and inverse problems. When deep learning is used for model reduction,
many works focus on designing network architectures and proposing training techniques to obtain
successful predictions for specific problems. The mathematical and statistical understandings of these
techniques are limited. The widely open and challenging questions are: 1) How can one interpret the
success or failure of model reduction by deep neural networks? 2) How can one improve model
reduction by ensuring mathematical interpretability, adaptivity, and robustness?
This project aims to answer these fundamental questions to advance the mathematical and statistical
understandings of deep learning. This project has three thrusts. Thrust A aims to develop interpretable
deep learning-based nonlinear model reduction methods, analyze the generalization error, and explore
various network architectures. Thrust B studies the benefits of neural networks in discovering intrinsic
data structures and adapting to function regularity at different scales and locations. Thrust C focuses on
computational improvements and science applications of model reduction techniques. This project has
a potential to drive significant advances in scientific machine learning. The proposed model-reduction
methods can be used to analyze large datasets and simulate complex phenomena in physics, biology,
and engineering. The investigation on interpretability, generalization error, adaptivity, and adversarial
robustness will advance the mathematics of deep learning and model reduction.

Analog-Digital Hybrid Simulation of Quantum Field Theories with Advanced Ion Traps
Norbert M. Linke
Duke Quantum Center and Department of Physics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27701
norbert.linke@duke.edu
Quantum field theory (QFT) is a powerful theoretical framework that underpins much of modern
physics, helping us understand subatomic particles and their interactions. However, computing the
dynamics of QFT models can be an immensely challenging task. Quantum computers promise to
efficiently simulate such models using qubits, which are computational bits that take advantage of
quantum phenomena like entanglement and superpositions to create powerful quantum algorithms.
But encoding physical interactions involving photons and other bosonic particles is difficult even for
these advanced systems due to the infinite-dimensional state spaces involved. To overcome this
challenge, we are developing an analog-digital hybrid quantum simulator based on trapped ions. Linear
chains of atomic ions trapped in free space with electric fields offer exceptional qubit properties and
are a leading platform for quantum computing. In our scheme, the ion qubits are combined with
multiple sets of vibrational modes, represented by the motion of the ion chain in the trap. These modes
are a quantum version of the overtones on a guitar-string and provide additional quantum resources.
They can not only facilitate discrete, or digital, quantum computational gates by coupling different ions
together but also act as bosonic degrees of freedom directly. This follows the idea of analog quantum
simulation, where a quantum system is engineered to evolve like another system of interest. Using both
digital and analog elements allows for more efficient encoding and simulation of QFT problems. We are
constructing a new type of ion trap based on micro-fabrication of 3-dimensional glass structures to
create the ideal experimental platform for analog-digital hybrid quantum simulations.
Probing the Emergent Hadron Mass through Pion Structure Measurement at the AMBER Experiment
Dr. Kun Liu, Staff Scientist
Physics Division
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
Los Alamos, NM 87545
Understanding the origin of the hadron mass, which constitutes 99% of our visible universe, is one of the
central goals of nuclear physics. The Higgs mechanism, although provides mass for the fundamental
building blocks of the mater, can only contribute a very small fraction (~1%) of the nucleon mass by itself.
The vast majority of the mass is believed to come from the strong force that tightly binds quarks and
gluons together. Therefore, measurement of the quark and gluon structure of the hadron is of utmost
importance in understanding how the hadron mass emerges through the strong interaction. Any
successful theory needs to reconcile both the heavy proton mass and the very light pion mass
simultaneously. In contrast to the abundant experimental measurements of the proton structure, the data
on the pion structure is very scarce and outdated. The goal of this research is to provide a comprehensive
study of the internal structure of the pion by colliding high-energy pions with a carbon target at the AMBER
experiment at CERN. The primary R&D of this study involves the development of a silicon-strip-based
vertex detector, which will significantly improve the reconstruction precision of the AMBER spectrometer
and consequently leads to the best measurement of the pion structure to date. The result yielded from
this study will provide the needed sensitivity to understand and constrain the mechanisms responsible for
the emergence of the hadron mass.

Resurgence of Markov Random Fields for Scientific Machine Learning: New
Mathematics for an Old Framework
Dr. Andrey Lokhov, Staff Scientist Applied
Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group
Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos, NM 87545
Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a general class of probability distributions related to Boltzmann
distribution in physics, Gibbs measure in mathematics, undirected graphical models in computer science,
or energy-based models in machine learning. MRFs have been used for modeling of natural systems at
equilibrium since the creation of statistical physics, and hence serve as a natural and interpretable
modeling foundation for many scientific applications. Yet, unknown training algorithms, as well as the lack
of tools for generating predictions from these models present the main barriers to the widespread use of
MRFs in Scientific Machine Learning. This project aims at eliminating these known barriers by advancing
the mathematics behind machine learning methods for MRFs. We address the challenge of designing a
suite of efficient learning algorithms that incorporate physical symmetries, deal with heterogeneous and
noisy data sets, construct MRFs in a form which allows for generation of predictions and sampling, and
have a robust implementation. As a demonstration of a wide applicability of the developed methods, this
project focuses on open problems in several distinct scientific areas that require rigorous learning of
interpretable and physics-informed probabilistic network models from distributed data: many-body
quantum physics, power grids, turbulence, and field theories.

Integrating Machine Learning Models into E3SM for Understanding Coastal Compound Flooding
Dr. Dan Lu, Senior Staff Scientist
Computational Sciences and Engineering Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37831
Coastal-urban regions in the United States are home to 40% of the nation‚Äôs total population, produce
more than $9.5 trillion in goods and services, and employ 58.3 million people. They have a high
concentration of infrastructure, are often economic centers, and are crucial in water and nutrient
cycling. But unfortunately, these regions suffer from severe flooding, and backwater effects caused by
pluvial, fluvial, and coastal processes that greatly exacerbate the flood risks. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to improve understanding and simulation of backwater effects and mitigate the induced
floods, and this urgency is escalating with increasing coastal development, population growth, and
vulnerability of infrastructure to the floods. However, coastal backwater effects are difficult to simulate
because of their multiple interactive drivers and complex, interrelated land-river-ocean processes. The
effects have not been well represented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) partly
because of insufficiency of incorporating data and deficiency in model grid configuration. Coastal-urban
regions usually have many sensors, observatories, and radars that collect vast amounts of in situ and
remote sensing data. These data contain critical information about drivers, processes, and their
influences on coastal flooding. To address knowledge and modeling gaps in coastal-urban regions, this
project will extract information from multi-source, multi-type data; develop mesh-free, data-informed,
and physics- embedded river models using machine learning methods; and couple the river model with
E3SM land and ocean models to advance predictive understanding of coastal compound flooding under
climate change. The project will focus on two Mid-Atlantic River Basins, Susquehanna River Basin and
Delaware River Basin, which include significant urban areas, have more than 4 million residents, and
suffer from severe coastal flooding.
This research will advance understanding of feedbacks and interactions of extreme events at
coastal- urban systems, enhance E3SM capabilities in simulating coastal compound floods with
uncertainty quantification, and inform urban planning to mitigate the impact of climate change on
communities, infrastructures, and economy.

Data-Driven Discovery of Dynamic Models to Characterize Energy Systems
Dr. Niall Mangan, Assistant Professor
Engineering Sciences and Applied
Mathematics Northwestern University
Evanston, IL 60208
Rapid characterization of the generation, extraction, and storage of energy is an intrinsic problem across
application areas, including material and biological systems. Physical modeling has traditionally been a
powerful technique to gain human-interpretable insight into energy system's behavior. Recently, model
selection methods using sparse optimization have provided means of data-driven, semi-automatic
model generation and parametrization. However, methodological gaps limit the computational
feasibility of model selection for systems with unmeasured variables and identifiability issues and from
complex data sets with multiple underlying systems behaviors. This research will accelerate the rate at
which we can characterize energy systems from complex data by developing new methods for sparse
model discovery and experimental design for mechanistically-interpretable ordinary differential
equations (ODEs).
A semi-automated method for discovering mechanistic ODE models would revolutionize our ability to
rapidly understand energy systems. By combining state-of-the-art nonlinear parameter estimation
with sparse penalization, our framework will expand the practical and computational limits of data-
driven model construction from complex, real-world datasets. We will advance sparse-experimental
design by integrating identifiability analysis with sparse optimization to inform the quantity and
quality of data required and set guidelines for when model selection is feasible and robust. Finally, we
will connect automated model discovery to perturbation theory to characterize complex data sets
where multiple asymptotic limits (simplified models) are required to characterize distinct mechanistic
behaviors across
time and variation in control parameters. While we will develop the method in the context of target
biological and materials systems, such methods will be extendable to any system where nonlinear
dynamics terms determine the behavior of a dynamical system (biochemistry, environmental systems,
device physics, materials chemistry, catalysis science, etc.).

A multi-experiment common framework for neutrino cross section uncertainties
Dr. Chris Marshall, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy
University of Rochester
Rochester, NY 14627
What are the uncertainties on neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections? This question faces all neutrino
oscillation experiments, and sounds very simple but is actually extremely complicated. Experiments use
``event generators'' to simulate neutrino interactions, which rely on largely empirical models that are
tuned to external measurements. However, large uncertainties remain, and a huge amount of effort goes
into understanding how wrong these models might be, and in what ways. This becomes even more
important as our experiments get more and more precise.
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is the next generation long-baseline oscillation
experiment. Scheduled to start physics in 2028, DUNE will measure oscillations using liquid argon time
projection chambers as both Near and Far Detectors. The Short Baseline Program (SBN) at Fermilab has
essentially the same setup but a much shorter baseline, and will start its two-detector physics run next
year. These two experiments both need a robust framework for tuning the interaction model and
describing its uncertainty. Furthermore, measurements made in SBN will be crucial inputs to eventual
analysis in DUNE. The aim of this research is to develop a common tool for neutrino cross section
uncertainties, and to integrate this tool into the analysis frameworks of both DUNE and SBN. The goal is
for the huge effort of understanding neutrino-argon interactions and implementing uncertainties to be
largely shared, and to make it straightforward to connect cross section measurements at SBN to oscillation
sensitivities at DUNE.

Building a Scientific Foundation for a New Generation of Low Energy Adsorptive Separations:
Probing the Role of Responsive Structural Flexibility using Synthetic Porous Frameworks
Dr. C. Michael McGuirk, Assistant
Professor Department of
Chemistry Colorado School of
Mines
Golden, CO 80401
We are elucidating fundamental insights into the relationship of cooperative flexibility in porous
adsorbents and low-energy adsorptive separations. Our objective is to use hypothesis-driven empirical
and computational efforts to understand the key structural and energetic variables of cooperative
flexibility that influence selectivity and kinetics of adsorption, and thus separations from relevant
mixtures. Metal‚Äìorganic frameworks, both rigid and flexible, serve as the model platform for these
studies, owing to their diversity, intuitive synthesis, high crystallinity, and computational feasibility.
Specifically, we are using a series of established frameworks with previously characterized structures and
observed flexibility, alongside the corresponding rigid structural analogs serving as control materials.
These efforts will significantly advance the atomic- to meso-scale understanding of responsive cooperative
flexibility in porous adsorbents. They will build a scientific foundation that promotes the intuitive design
and application of cooperative flexibility in the pursuit of low-energy adsorptive separations for societally
critical separations, such as purification of commodity chemicals, removal of pollutants from the
environment, and isolation of critical minerals and elements.

Ultrafast Control of Topological Transport in Quantum Materials
Dr. James McIver, Assistant
Professor Department of
Physics Columbia University
New York, NY 10027
Topological quantum materials host large, anomalous, and often dissipationless electrical and magnetic
transport responses arising from the non-trivial geometric nature of their electronic wavefunctions.
Discovering pathways to actively induce and manipulate these responses using external stimuli is a central
goal of the physical sciences because it could lead to functionalities based on the dissipationless energy
transfer for applications in energy-efficient sensing and quantum information science.
This research program will engineer new forms of on-demand topological charge transport in quantum
materials using femtosecond pulses of light. The electrical transport dynamics of light-induced topological
states will be directly captured using a chip-scale ultrafast optoelectronic device architecture. The
proposed strategy is to use ultrafast light-mater interaction to manipulate the topological character of
materials by coherently breaking or imposing specific electronic symmetries, the nature of which can be
controlled by adjusting the wavelength, intensity and polarization of the optical pulse. Mechanisms based
on this strategy include the formation of photon-dressed Floquet states and the transient distortion of
materials‚Äô crystal structure via the generation of coherent lattice vibrations. These mechanisms are
predicted to lead to novel topological transport responses with no equilibrium counterpart. The results
will further our fundamental understanding of topological phenomena out of equilibrium, establish new
paradigms for optically manipulating quantum materials, and lay the groundwork for next-generation,
energy efficient technologies.

Pushing the Boundaries of Precision:
N3LO Predictions for the LHC
Dr. Bernhard Mistlberger, Staff Scientist
Theory Group, Fundamental Physics Directorate
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, California, 94025
High energy scattering experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are crucial tools to deepen our
understanding of fundamental interactions at high energy. In the absence of the discovery of new particles
searching for deviations of measurements from our expectation and stringently probing our current
understanding of interactions take the highest priority. Consequently, realizing the full potential of LHC
phenomenology critically relies on our ability to predict the outcome of LHC measurements. The rapid
advance of LHC experiments towards a high-precision era of probing the electroweak energy regime and
the Higgs boson calls for the development of a new and improved level of precision predictions, which is
the explicit goal of this research. Specifically, the goal is to establish so-called N3LO (next-to-next-to-next-
to-leading order) Quantum Chromodynamics computations as a standard for precision LHC
phenomenology. This requires developing innovative ideas and algorithms for both analytical and
numerical calculations of scattering cross sections, as well as refining our understanding of scattering
theory. The outcome of this research will provide the wider scientific community with the knowledge and
tools needed to tackle the challenges of the upcoming high-precision era at the LHC. Additionally, this
research will generate cutting-edge predictions for key LHC measurements, offering valuable insights into
the behavior of particles at the electroweak energy regime and the Higgs boson. By pushing the
boundaries of precision in our predictions and contributing to the advancement of particle physics, this
research brings us closer to unraveling the mysteries of the universe and deepening our understanding of
the fundamental laws that govern it.

Physically Motivated Linking of Resolutions in Multiscale Models
to Predict Thermal and Charge Transport in Self-Assembling Soft Materials
Jacob I. Monroe, Assistant Professor
Ralph E. Martin Department of Chemical Engineering
University of Arkansas
Fayetteville, AR 72701
Multiscale materials composed of hierarchical structures are common in nature. To take inspiration from
nature and engineer our own multiscale soft materials, such as those based on proteins or polymers, we
require a better understanding of how material properties arise from close couplings of structures and
interactions across a range of length scales. Simulations that explicitly represent every atom in every
molecule, as well as the interactions between them, are crucial for gaining insight into the molecular-level
origins of thermodynamic and transport properties of materials. However, such simulations are
computationally expensive and thus limited to small length and time scales. As a result, coarser models
are also necessary, for describing mesoscale structures that also impact a material‚Äôs properties.
Unfortunately, mesoscale structures themselves subtly depend on atomic-level behavior, meaning that
material properties typically arise from a complex interplay across length scales. Controlling this interplay
is currently a grand challenge in polymeric materials used in flexible electronics, where material
performance depends on both atomic-level details and mesoscale structure. Understanding these
connections will help to design more robust, lightweight, ecofriendly electronics, as well as wearable
sensors.
Rather than consider simulations at different resolutions as separate information sources, our innovative
approach connects coarse and fine simulations within a single framework. To do this, we synthesize
knowledge of physics with machine learning to build models that capture the information that is lost or
gained in switching between resolutions. Our methodology is called variational autoencoder-based Monte
Carlo (VAE-based MC), which provides a way to switch from an atomistic to a coarse-grained model,
enhance sampling of configurations in the coarse model, and switch back to a finer resolution. In this way,
we benefit from the larger length and time scales accessible to the coarse-grained model but recover the
atomistic details necessary for building understanding on a molecular level. Excitingly, applying this
methodology naturally identifies how models at different resolutions relate to each other and provides
insight into how we can improve our multiscale modeling efforts by adjusting the way information flows
between simulations at different scales. Our goal is to apply these techniques to better understand the
connections between mesoscale structure and charge transport in electrically conductive polymeric
materials. Our efforts will clarify the fundamental information that needs to be transmitted between
atomistic and coarse-grained models of soft materials, generally advancing the state of the art in
multiscale modeling.

Disentangling Nonlinear Spectroscopy to Control Nonequilibrium Energy Transport
Dr. Andr√©s Montoya Castillo, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Colorado
Boulder Boulder, CO 80309
Recent advances in multidimensional spectroscopy provide unprecedented resolution in time, energy,
and space, offering exciting new opportunities to reveal how molecules in solution and in extended
molecular frameworks absorb, share, transport, and lose energy. These insights have the potential to
guide the design of materials with technologically important properties such as the ability to direct
transport for optimal energy conversion, manipulate charge flow for enhanced catalytic activity and
selectivity, or suppress decoherence for robust quantum technologies (qubits, sensors, and memories).
Unfortunately, this requires the ability to predict, interpret, and assign the spectral responses of
condensed phase systems, which remains a formidable open challenge. This is especially difficult when
the likelihood that molecules absorb light changes dynamically with nuclear motions (non-Condon effects)
and when the molecular interactions prevent the application of simplified harmonic theories. To address
this gap, we will develop and apply methods to predict nonlinear spectra of chromophores beyond the
Condon limit, capture the signatures of nonadiabatic energy transfer in nonlinear spectra, and leverage
physics-based machine learning to diagnose and manipulate energy transfer mechanisms. We will initially
apply our techniques to predict and elucidate the energy transfer processes revealed by the
multidimensional optical spectra of photosynthetic and chlorophyll-carotenoid complexes that are crucial
in photoprotection, and porphyrin-based systems, as these are highly tunable and critical ingredients in
natural and artificial energy conversion and electrocatalysis. We will then leverage the resulting insights
to develop design principles for directed energy transport and tunable optoelectronic properties in
porphyrin systems for applications in energy conversion and catalysis. Our proposed advances will be
broadly applicable and offer a promising tool to interrogate and manipulate the optical and transport
properties of systems ranging from biological dyes, to disordered organic semiconductors, and
perovskites.

Improving Predictability of Aqueous Coastal Biogeochemistry During Floods, Storms and a Warming
Climate
Dr. Julia Moriarty, Assistant Professor
Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Institute for Alpine and Arctic Research
University of Colorado Boulder
Boulder, CO 80303
Major human health and water quality issues are caused by flooding of coastal urban infrastructure,
such as sewer systems, wastewater treatment plants, and nuclear power reactors. Floods in these
coastal urban regions may directly impact local waterways by delivering bacterial and/or radioactive
contaminants into local rivers and estuaries. In addition, the delivery of excess levels of nutrients can
stimulate potentially harmful algal blooms, reduce oxygen levels and reduce water clarity, all of which
impact biogeochemical budgets and local ecosystems and communities. Yet, these facilities, i.e. sewer
systems, wastewater treatment plants and nuclear power reactors, are particularly prone to flooding
because of engineering constraints that require proximity to shorelines for effluent discharge and
large supplies of water. As climate changes, floods of coastal urban areas are likely to become more
frequent and extreme due to rising sea levels, changes in precipitation extremes, and slower storms.
Climate- change-driven alterations in flood characteristics will also impact how precipitation events
affect biogeochemistry in coastal waterways, including estuaries where many urban centers are
located.
Additionally, in urban settings, warmer temperatures and changes in land use may impact the delivery
of contaminated water and excess nutrients, as well as the rates of biogeochemical processes. Advances
in process-based modeling and machine learning have improved our understanding of floods and their
impact on biogeochemistry in coastal urban waterways. Yet, a predictive understanding of coastal urban
biogeochemistry remains difficult during extreme events.
This project will combine process-based and statistical machine learning modeling to address the Grand
Challenge of modeling hydro-biogeochemistry during extreme events in coastal urban waterways.
Specifically, the objective of this project is to analyze how floods of coastal infrastructure impact
pollutant and nutrient fluxes to local waterways, and their impact on estuarine biogeochemical
processes, on subseasonal timescales (days to a couple months) in modern-day and future climates. The
city of Baltimore will be used as a case study to build on and contribute to ongoing DOE and local
efforts, including the Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative (BSEC) Urban Integrated Field
Laboratory (Urban IFL). Model results from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) climate
model, as well as the implementation and analysis of a local Baltimore hydrodynamic-biogeochemistry
model, will be used to better understand how coastal urban flooding impacts local estuarine
biogeochemistry in different climate scenarios. Additionally, a combination of machine learning and
sensitivity tests of the process-based model will be used to explore upscaling local observations and
models from the Baltimore case study to coastal-urban system to worldwide.

Enabling Multiscale Laminography for Operando 3D Microscopy without Geometric Restrictions
Dr. Johanna Nelson Weker, Lead Scientist
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Lightsource SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory Menlo Park, CA 94025
The objective of this research is to enable multiscale computed laminography for micron and nanometer
resolution 3D imaging of extended samples such as standard pouch cell batteries. Standard computed
tomography techniques do not work well for samples with flat geometries resulting in reconstructed
volumes with imaging artifacts and poor contrast. Yet this battery geometry is commercially relevant and
compatible with most other X-ray characterization. The research will study the 3D morphological and
chemical changes occurring in operating batteries at both the hundreds-of-particles and single-particle
level. The nanometer scale 3D imaging will provide information on how individual particles and interfaces
are behaving, and micron scale will illuminate the heterogenous behavior of many particles to provide the
statistical performance at the electrode level and any ‚Äúcrosstalk‚Äù between the cathode and anode. The
development of 3D imaging of extended, flat samples will fill a significant characterization gap and is
widely applicable to other important energy systems such as hydrogen fuel cells, flow batteries, and
microelectronic devices.

Understanding Irradiation-Assisted Plasticity in Complex Concentrated Alloys
Dr. Hyunseok Oh, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Madison, WI 53706
This proposal addresses the strength-toughness trade-off challenge in structural metals under irradiation
at intermediate temperatures (<0.4 melting point). In these conditions, irradiation and mechanical stress
result in hardening and embrittlement via significant strain localization at dislocation channels, which is a
critical contributor to irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking. Leveraging recent advancements in
complex-concentrated alloys (CCAs ‚Äì metallic alloys with multiple principal elements in high
concentrations), this project will investigate the effects of microstructure on irradiation-assisted plasticity
in CCAs and identify scientific principles for enhanced irradiation embrittlement resistance. Our focus is
on the reduction in strain localization through tailoring deformation mechanisms, a process called planar-
defect mediated delocalized plasticity (PMDP). PDMP has been shown to strongly influence mechanical
behavior in unirradiated CCAs. To achieve this goal, we will systematically design and fabricate model CCAs
and employ a range of advanced characterization methods, such as synchrotron-based analyses, high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atom-probe tomography, to examine the structural
factors of CCAs before and after irradiation. We intend to utilize heavy ion irradiation, electron channeling
contrast imaging, and nanoindentation to facilitate the investigation of a vast number of samples in a high-
throughput manner. Subsequently, we will analyze the plasticity mechanisms of selected samples using
proton irradiation and in-situ tensile tests within a scanning electron microscope. This project will
enhance understanding of the complex structural response of CCAs to coupled radiation and mechanical
stress. The principles developed through this work will guide the development of new CCAs and can be
applied to other structural metals, thus improving irradiation embrittlement resistance in advanced
nuclear energy systems.

Multimessenger tomography of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions
Dr. Jean-Fran√ßois Paquet, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics & Astronomy and Department of
Mathematics
Vanderbilt University
Nashville, TN 37240
The protons and neutrons that form atomic nuclei are themselves made of smaller constituents known
as quarks and gluons. When heavy nuclei are accelerated close to the speed of light and made to collide,
a hot plasma of these elementary quarks and gluons is produced at the point of impact. The
composition and temperature of this plasma are comparable to the state of the Universe microseconds
after the Big Bang. The plasma radiates light at different wavelengths in the gamma-ray energy range,
which has been measured in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The light's energy spectrum and its direction of emission provide a unique
window into the properties of the hottest regions of the plasma. In this research project, this
electromagnetic radiation will be used to probe the viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma and, critically,
study how it changes with the plasma's temperature. This will offer valuable insights into the plasma's
transition from a liquid to a gas phase as its temperature increases. Measurements of electromagnetic
radiation will be combined with other data sets to obtain state-of-the-art constraints on the plasma's
viscosity. Machine learning techniques will be used to accelerate simulations of nuclear collisions and
assist the statistical analysis of the data.

Modeling fast ion-mode interactions toward a stellarator fusion power plant
Dr. Elizabeth Paul, Assistant Professor
Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics
Columbia University
New York, NY 10027
One of the primary requirements for an effective fusion power plant (FPP) is the sufficient confinement of
the fusion products, the energetic alpha particles produced in the deuterium-tritium reaction. These
energetic particles must be confined sufficiently long such that they can deposit their energy in the
thermal bulk and maintain the fusion burn. Furthermore, rapid losses must be avoided to mitigate
destruction of the material walls of the fusion device. Energetic particles have historically been challenging
to confine in stellarator magnetic confinement devices due to the possibility of unconfined orbits in the
three- dimensional magnetic field. With recent advances in the numerical optimization of stellarator
magnetic fields, new configurations have been obtained with excellent confinement of fusion-born alpha
particles in the absence of perturbations. This breakthrough demonstrates that a stellarator may serve as
an effective fusion power plant. There is, however, the potential for enhanced alpha losses due to
interactions with perturbations in the background plasma. In particular, experimental measurements on
magnetic confinement devices indicate that the resonant interactions between energetic particles (EPs)
and shear Alfven waves drive substantial transport. Alfvenic activity is considered one of the major
limitations to alpha particle confinement in a burning plasma.
Given the potential impact of fast ion instabilities in a stellarator FPP, we are motivated to advance the
3D modeling capabilities to efficiently and faithfully understand the nonlinear dynamics of mode-particle
interactions and control them through 3D shaping. Looking forward to the many calculations required for
scenario development and optimization of the magnetic field, we focus on applying reduced models and
advanced computational techniques. The proposed work takes advantage of advances made in the related
fields of condensed mater theory and dynamical systems in order to efficiently calculate the structure of
the shear Alfven continuum and the impact of Alfven modes on the phase-space structure. Reduced
quasilinear models will be developed and validated in order to more effectively interpret present day
experiments and predict future FPPs. These models will be used to design new stellarator FPP concepts
with enhanced EP confinement using numerical optimization techniques.

Understanding Nucleation and Film Growth Processes of
Solution-Processable Renewable Energy Materials Printed from Confined Volumes
Dr. Adam Printz, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering
University of Arizona
Tucson, AZ 85721
Solution-processable semiconductors have shown great promise for next-generation energy technologies
including, but not limited to, photovoltaics, supercapacitors, and batteries. However, the current scalable
printing techniques for these materials result in reduced performance and stability of these layers,
because the quality of films generated by these processes is poorer than in lab-scale fabrication
techniques with greater process control such as spin-coating. Printing from confined volumes is a
promising new approach that enables direct environmental control over the ink as it is being deposited
onto the substrate‚Äîe.g., temperature, confinement gap (the distance between the substrate and
superstrate), surface interactions, etc. The objective of this project is to answer the following three
interrelated questions: (1) How does the high surface area-to-volume ratio of the substrate/superstrate
and ink influence the nucleation and growth in solution-processed thin films? (2) Can a model for thin film
growth from solution be developed that is analogous to the Structure Zone Model for thin film growth
from vacuum deposition? and (3) How do the surface energies and chemistries of confining surfaces
influence crystal nucleation and growth as well as the resultant film morphology?
These questions will be answered by correlating experimental spectroscopy and microscopy
measurements with molecular dynamics simulations and computational fluid dynamics/phase-field
modeling. The outcomes of this project will be the development of fundamental understanding and
modeling of the molecular-scale nucleation and film growth processes of solution-processed thin films
deposited from confined volumes. These efforts will be a significant step toward film-growth control
analogous to that developed for vacuum deposition processes, leading to scalable meniscus-guided
deposition processes that result in high-quality energy conversion and storage materials with lower cost,
higher performance, and longer operating lifetimes than the current state-of-the-art.

From Molecules to Continuum: Exploring a Universal, Transferable, and Physics-Based Understanding of Chemical
Dynamics from ab-initio
Dr. Jin Qian, Staff Scientist
Chemical Science Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
Chemical dynamics ‚Äì the coordinated symphony of photons, electrons, protons, and atoms ‚Äì dominate
the efficacy of energy harvesting in numerous renewable energy applications across a diverse portfolio of
DOE Basic Energy Sciences priorities, from Direct Air Capture to Liquid Solar Fuel. The need for electronic
structure theory guided predictions and interpretations of spectroscopic information is surging, driven by
significant recent progress in multimodal experimental spectroscopies that probe chemical dynamics
across a multitude of spatial, temporal, and energy scales. Due to its high accuracy-to-cost ratio, DFT,
generally referring to the mathematically proven Kohn-Sham DFT (KS-DFT) formulism, has been the
method-of-choice connecting theory and experiment. Yet, key distinctions persist among dominant DFT
practitioners: quantum chemists favor orbital-like basis sets (e.g., gaussian type orbitals) and tend to focus
their efforts on isolated molecular systems; in contrast, solid-state physicists leverage plane-wave basis
sets (usually coupled with periodic boundary conditions) and tend to focus on descriptions of infinitely
extended systems. The most important renewable energy solutions, however, are complex, heterogenous
systems that are neither purely molecular nor crystalline. For example, gas phase molecules (such as CO
2
and H O) in nanoconfined environments encounter unique forces that transform their reaction outcomes.

These confinement effects can have profound implications for the future of energy supply and climate
change. As another example, noble metal nanoclusters efficiently capture light through plasmonic
resonances. The plasmon modes subsequently dephase into hot electrons and holes that can be harvested
to drive chemical reactions or transferred across nanoparticle-semiconductor interfaces for promising
photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications. Real-space KS-DFT is one of the most promising theoretical
methods for achieving electronic structure level insight into chemical dynamics in realistically large and
complex systems with up to >10,000 atoms. We will exploit the power of this method to unveil a
fundamentally new set of chemistry-structure-property relationships in heterogeneous systems at the
nanoscale, where geometry, confinement, and atomic interactions interplay. The computational findings
will be validated with multimodal spectroscopy experiments.

Toward a microscopic picture of hadronization and multi-parton processes
Dr. Felix Ringer, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Old Dominion University
Norfolk, VA 23529
Quarks and gluons are the fundamental building blocks of hadrons that make up a large fraction of the
visible mater in our universe. Their unique properties and interactions can be studied in detail at collider
experiments where they are produced at high energies. Quarks and gluons carry a color charge,
described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), that leads to their confinement into
colorless hadrons shortly after their creation in collider experiments. This transition, which leads to the
neutralization of color and the emergence of hadrons, is called hadronization. Despite extensive
research, a microscopic picture of the QCD hadronization process has remained elusive due to its
nonperturbative nature. Addressing this challenging question is one of the main frontiers of the US
nuclear physics program, and our limited understanding of the associated multi-parton processes has
become a bottleneck in various areas of high-energy nuclear and particle physics. To tackle this
question, this project will develop a multi-pronged approach by leveraging three distinct but related
methods: 1.
Perturbative QCD calculations of observables sensitive to multi-parton dynamics, 2. Quantum
simulations of real-time dependent correlation functions that are relevant to understand the complex
dynamics of hadronization, and 3. A.I. / Machine learning techniques that will provide new insights into
the microscopic picture of hadronization by identifying patterns in collider data. The confluence of these
different computational techniques will facilitate a novel and comprehensive approach to studying the
QCD hadronization process from multiple perspectives. The research of this project is of direct
relevance to the nuclear physics facilities in the US including the ongoing experiments at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as the future
Electron-Ion Collider.

materials‚Äîhas provided new insight into the diverse respiratory capacities of microbes and fueled the
potential for microbe-electrode biotechnologies. Our understanding of the mechanisms of extracellular
electron transfer stem from characterization of organisms that respire minerals as a sink for electrons in
place of oxygen during respiration. However, microbes are also capable of the reverse process, oxidation
of redox active substrates, or extracellular electron uptake (EEU). In this case microbes use an inorganic
substrate as an electron source of electrons. The biophysics of EEU in most systems is poorly understood.
The overarching goal of this work is to advance our understanding of the genetic and biochemical basis of
microbial EEU in microbes across physiologically and phylogenetically diverse strains.
This work builds off our recent high throughput genetic studies. In Shewanella oneidensis MR-1‚Äîa model
system capable of bi-directional extracellular electron transfer‚Äîwe recently identified two distinct genes
critical for EEU that will be purified to test the biochemical and electrochemical properties using thin film
electrochemical techniques. The results of this work will help us understand the role of these proteins in
EEU and bi-directional electron transfer‚Äîprocesses important for understanding Shewanella physiology,
and its utility for biotechnology applications.
This work will also apply our high throughput genetic techniques (i.e., Tn-Seq) to investigate a novel
mechanism of electron uptake in an environmentally isolated marine microbe, Pseudomonas stutzeri‚Äîa
facultative autotroph capable of processive electron uptake when compared with other model systems.
Though exploratory, we expect this work to point to a novel EEU pathway with the potential to expand
our understanding of EEU metabolism and biochemistry.
This work will also investigate the EEU phenotypes of proteins implicated in M. barkeri electron uptake
from electrodes. Previous electrochemical work in Methanosarcina demonstrated a low redox potential
electron uptake process that couples CO fixation to methane production. This work will leverage
2
Methanosarcina gene deletion mutants to investigate the role of specific proteins in EEU. This will provide
insights into the potential for non-cytochrome based mechanisms of EEU, and may identify potential
targets for engineering enhanced electron uptake rates in Methanosarcina.
The expected outcomes of this work will expand our understanding the mechanisms of EEU in diverse
microbial systems. We will gain insight into novel redox processes, as well as the ecology and biochemistry
of extremely important, applied and environmentally relevant groups of microbes.

Ion Acceleration by Quasi-Parallel Magnetized Collisionless Shocks
Dr. Derek Schaeffer, Assistant
Professor Department of Physics and
Astronomy University of California, Los
Angeles Los Angeles, CA 90095
Collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, from the bow shock created as the solar
wind impacts the Earth's magnetic field to the expanding shockwave of a supernova remnant. Unlike the
shockwaves generated by aircraft as they go supersonic, collisionless shocks form through
electromagnetic effects in systems where collisions between particles are rare. Additionally, these shocks
often form in pre-existing magnetic fields, so that the shock dynamics are highly dependent on the
direction the shock propagates relative to the background magnetic field. Of particular interest are quasi-
parallel shocks, in which the shock propagates primarily along the background magnetic field, and which
are considered a possible source of the some of the highest energy cosmic rays (i.e., ions) observed in the
universe. However, we currently lack an understanding of key aspects of how these ions are accelerated
to extreme energies, with multiple competing theories and incomplete hints from satellite observations
of shocks in space. Additionally, recent advances have enabled collisionless shocks to be created
experimentally using high-powered lasers, but quasi-parallel shocks have yet to be created in the
laboratory. To address the challenge of quasi-parallel shock acceleration, this research will combine
laboratory experiments, state- of-the-art numerical modeling tools, shock theory, and spacecraft
observations. The primary objectives will be to demonstrate quasi-parallel shock formation in the
laboratory, measure shock-accelerated particles, and compare the results to numerical simulations and
observations of astrophysical shocks. To accomplish this, the experiments will use the largest lasers in the
world, combined with intense magnetic fields, to achieve for the first time the conditions for quasi-parallel
shock formation and particle acceleration. This work will open up a new class of experiments on particle
acceleration and will lead to significant advances in our fundamental understanding of strongly-driven,
magnetized plasmas.

Functionalization of 2D Materials Heterostructures for Solar Energy Conversion
Dr. Arunima Singh, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ 85287
Solar-driven catalytic water-splitting processes provide clean, renewable, and sustainable forms of
hydrogen for generating electricity via fuel cells. The most daunting challenge in the solar-driven catalysis
process is the dearth of photocatalysts that simultaneously provide high efficiencies as well as long-term
durability in the highly corrosive conditions needed for the photocatalytic reactions. A promising approach
to push the limits of solar-energy-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is to utilize record-breaking
photoabsorbers to maximize the capture of sunlight then use an outstanding and robust catalyst to drive
the catalytic reaction at a superior reaction rate. However, the interfaces of bulk photoabsorbers and
catalysts are poorly understood. This research aims to expand our understanding of heterostructures of
record-breaking photoabsorbers, like silicon, gallium arsenide, and cadmium telluride, and two-
dimensional (2D) materials which excel as catalysts due to high specific surface area and a wide range of
tunable properties. Through high-throughput ab-initio simulations and physics-based machine learning
modeling, the atomic-scale structure, electronic-structure, and interface physics of 2D-bulk material
heterostructures will be studied and curated in an open-source database. The physics-based machine
learning models and the computed data will be used for a data-driven discovery of water-splitting
photocatalytic heterostructures that push the limits of catalytic reactivity and at the same time yield
corrosion-resistant durable heterostructures with massive solar energy capturing capacity. In particular,
for this data-driven photocatalytic heterostructure discovery, this research will study (a) the role of an
electric field at the 2D-bulk materials interface in enhancing the reactivity of the 2D catalysts, (b) the
corrosion-resistance of 2D materials that can form protective barriers to the inherently corrosive
photoabsorbers and (c) the fundamentals of heterostructures‚Äô interface-physics that yields massive
numbers of photogenerated electrons to facilitate the water-splitting reaction.

Vibrational Dynamics and Relaxations in Glass-forming Liquids
Dr. Hillary Smith, Assistant
Professor Department of Physics &
Astronomy Swarthmore College
Swarthmore, PA 19081
The important applications of glasses are ubiquitous in our daily lives, ranging from rewriteable optical
storage media to amorphous silicates for optical fibers to encapsulation of nuclear waste. Glasses are
solids, like crystals, but uniform and without long-range order, like liquids. The easiest way to make a glass
is to heat a material until it is a molten liquid, then cool it to room temperature quickly enough to prevent
the atoms from forming a periodic (crystalline) structure. As the liquid cools, it reaches a point when the
material stops flowing and becomes a glass. This important transition occurs at the glass transition
temperature. How the remarkable properties of glasses arise from the nature of the glass transition is one
of the central questions in condensed mater physics. This is a challenging problem to address because the
liquid, right before it becomes a glass, is not stable. Observation of the dynamics of the atoms in this
unique, metastable phase requires new experimental tools. This research addresses this problem with a
cutting-edge application of neutron scattering techniques uniquely available at the Spallation Neutron
Source at Oak Ridge National Lab. Experiments on a range of glasses will address gaps in our knowledge
of the microscopic dynamics of so-called supercooled liquids near the glass transition. A new
understanding of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids will help shape our theories of phase transitions
and states of mater and is central to predicting the important properties of glasses that we exploit for a
wide range of applications.

Quantum Field Theory Tools for Gravitational Wave Science Dr.
Mikhail Solon, Assistant Professor Department of
Physics and Astronomy
University of California, Los Angeles
Los Angeles, California 90095
The emergence of gravitational wave science has opened a new direction in theoretical high energy
physics: leveraging quantum field theory (QFT) to develop new tools for state-of-the-art calculations of
gravitational wave signals. Future gravitational wave observatories will detect millions of binary mergers
per year with sensitivity far beyond the current limits of the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) facilities, ushering
gravitational wave science into an era of precision. The possibilities for new and unexpected discoveries
in astronomy, cosmology, and particle physics are staggering, but hinge crucially on complementary
advances in our theoretical modeling of gravitational wave sources. This research program will apply
modern tools from theoretical high energy physics, which have been honed over decades for precision
studies of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to develop a precise and systematically improvable
framework for gravitational wave signals. This will complement results from numerical relativity, and
enable precision measurements at future gravitational wave detectors, including searches for new
physics. In turn, applying QFT in this new territory will uncover new theoretical structures and tools that
can deepen our understanding of fundamental aspects of QFT.
This project brings together the mathematical and physical tools of theoretical high energy physics to
tackle significant problems in gravitational wave science, with the following objectives: 1) Formulate
gravitational wave phenomenology as a problem in QFT, and apply tools from theoretical high energy
physics such as effective field theory, scattering amplitudes, and advanced multiloop integration. 2)
Provide precise predictions for black hole and neutron star binaries, including corrections from radiative,
spin, and tidal effects. These analytic results will complement results from numerical relativity to produce
state-of-the-art gravitational waveforms. 3) Identify theoretical structures that emerge in the classical
regime of scattering amplitudes and develop them into active tools for computation. Examples are the
high-energy limit, and nonperturbative relations to classical solutions and to background spacetimes.

Selective Degradation of Polymer Waste to Commodity Chemicals
Dr. Erin Stache, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Princeton University
Princeton, NJ 08544
While plastics have enabled our modern society, the scale of commercial polymer production, dismal
recycling levels, and the absence of environmental degradation pathways have led to the vast
accumulation of plastics in the environment. This proposal leverages fundamental principles of organic
chemistry to convert polymer waste into valuable commodity chemicals. Using polymer waste as a
commodity chemical feedstock lessens dependence on fossil fuels and remediates plastic buildup in the
environment. We will develop selective strategies for valorizing polymer waste using the fundamental
kinetics and thermodynamics of C‚ÄìH bonds and abstraction agents. We will convert commercial polymers
into divergent commodity chemical streams through selective C‚ÄìH abstraction and modulation of reaction
conditions. We will also demonstrate selective valorization in mixed polymer waste based on kinetic and
thermodynamic selectivity principles. Successful demonstration of these fundamental science approaches
will motivate new recycling approaches and research into the chemical upcycling of commercial polymer
waste.

Bulk Synthesis of Rare-Earth-Free Tetrataenite Permanent Magnets
Dr. Mathew A. Steiner, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical and Materials
Engineering University of Cincinnati
Cincinnati, OH 45223
This project will elucidate the underlying factors driving the recent first bulk synthesis of Fe-Ni L10 ordered
tetrataenite permanent magnets, a breakthrough discovery that had been sought for nearly five decades
before being announced this last year. Fe-Ni tetrataenite magnets have the potential to replace the rare-
earth permanent magnets currently powering electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators,
though the only bulk samples of this material had previously been found in meteorites. Previous bulk
synthesis approaches were not able to overcome the extremely long diffusion times (millions of years)
required to achieve the L10 ordered phase in the binary Fe-Ni system, since overcome by incorporation
of phosphorus within the casting process. Such a scalable casting-based approach defies previous scientific
consensus regarding viable processing routes for producing this ordered phase transformation, and at this
moment there is little scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the processing
route, which is imperative to further development. This project will test key hypotheses regarding the
fundamental mechanisms that have enabled, for the first time, the bulk synthesis of tetrataenite, and
identify the combination of factors necessary to reliably reproduce the effect. Through a deeper
fundamental scientific understanding of the processing science, the long-term goal is to devise a scalable
processing route for bulk tetrataenite permanent magnets tailored to optimize their superior magnetic
properties. Fe-Ni is the only known earth-abundant system with the potential to rival the energy product
of rare-earth element permanent magnets, which are critical to multiple clean energy technologies and
the global transition to renewable energy, yet suffer from strategic supply issues, brittleness, and
susceptibility to corrosion.

Virtual Scientific Companion for Synchrotron Beamlines
Dr. Esther Tsai, Staff Scientist
Center for Functional Nanomaterials
Brookhaven National
Laboratory Upton, NY
11973
Synchrotrons are particle accelerators that generate extremely intense x-ray beams to enable discoveries
on the atomic and molecular level across energy science, quantum materials, life science, and more.
Synchrotron X-rays can, for example, reveal the internal 3D nano-structure of integrated circuits or human
cells as well as capture the dynamics of battery or photovoltaic operation. The high demand and
oversubscription of these specialized synchrotron beamlines call for dexterous and efficient control of
experiments for maximized productivity and sustainable top-level performance. Advances in artificial
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can be utilized for effective user facility operations and
accelerated material discovery. However, the full potential of AI/ML can only be realized when humans
are kept in the loop and natural language (NL) is the most intuitive and efficient way for humans to
communicate. This research will introduce a new paradigm of NL-controlled scientific exploration with
joint human-AI effort. Specifically, a virtual scientific companion (VISION) based on natural language
processing will be developed to transcribe NL voice to text, acquire and analyze data, visualize results, and
provide advanced learning algorithms and physics modelling to suggest optimal experiment design or
hypotheses. VISION will synergistically partner humans with computer controls for augmented human-AI-
facility performance at synchrotron beamlines and beyond, initiating a new era where NL-based
communication will be the only needed interface for scientific experimentation and design.

The Molecular Building Block Sampling Approach for Polymorphic Free Energy Calculations
Dr. Omar Valsson, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of North Texas
Denton, TX 76201
Polymorphism, the possibility of molecular crystals to have two or more crystalline phases with different
molecular agreements (e.g., packing and orientation of molecules) but identical in the chemical
formulation, has immense scientific and practical importance in chemistry, materials science, and the
pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries. Therefore, it is a vital task in the academic scientific field
and industry to identify different polymorphs and obtain their thermodynamic properties, such as their
relative populations. However, tackling molecular crystals is among the most challenging computational
chemistry tasks, especially for flexible molecules exhibiting conformational polymorphism. In this research
program, we will develop a novel enhanced sampling method for molecular dynamics simulations called
the Molecular Building Block Sampling Approach for tackling challenging temperature-mediated
polymorphic transition in molecular crystals that state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction methods
cannot describe. This free energy method will give us access to thermodynamic properties such as free
energy landscapes and relative stabilities of polymorphs at finite temperatures. The novelty of the
technique lies in biasing directly local order parameters that can describe both the inter-molecular and
intra-molecular degrees of freedom of the molecular building blocks of the crystal. This is a paradigm shift
compared to conventional enhanced sampling methods that employ global collective variables that
describe the state of the whole system. The outcome of this research program will be a novel enhanced
sampling method for tackling challenging polymorphic transition that can be applied to a wide range of
experimentally relevant molecular crystal systems. All methodological development resulting from the
proposed project will be made publicly available in open-source codes such as the PLUMED enhanced
sampling code.

Exploring Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Layered Topological Semimetals at Radio Frequencies
Dr. Ying Wang, Assistant Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Madison, WI 53706
Nonlinear light‚Äìmater interactions in the RF frequency range have become an important research frontier
for the advancement of quantum information and energy-sustainability technologies, such as
superconducting qubit coupling, nonlinear parametric amplification, and RF energy harvesting. These
functionalities require the presence of strong nonlinearities at RF frequencies, which are, unfortunately,
very limited. This research program aims to investigate novel quantum-geometrical properties and the
associated nonlinear RF processes in emergent layered topological semimetals. These materials arise as a
new and promising platform owing to their exotic topological band structures and large quantum
geometry, which can significantly influence and potentially enhance nonlinear light‚Äìmater interaction in
the RF regime. The study will focus on characterizing, modeling, and understanding the fundamental
relationship between RF electrodynamics, lattice symmetry, and quantum geometry. In addition, the
project will unravel the fundamental mechanisms and quantify the contributions of various intrinsic
factors and external stimuli on the nonlinear RF process. To achieve this, we will employ a combination of
advanced spectroscopies and transport measurements. The success of this research will advance the
understanding of nonlinear phenomena in quantum materials and establish a foundation for the
development of broadband, powerless, and efficient energy microelectronics.

Probing Electronic Structure in Actinide-Transition Metal Nitride Clusters
Dr. Cory Windorff, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry New Mexico State University
Las Cruces, NM 88003
How metals interact with one another affects observed physical properties, such as magnetism. Systems
with short metal-metal distances, including metal-metal bonding, tend to exhibit unusual physical
properties. The bonding of the actinides is intermediate between the largely covalent transition metals
(TMs) and the largely ionic rare earths, leading to the "f-electron problem", which is how much or how
little the f-electrons participate in bonding interactions. Recent attention has focused on the bonding and
electronic structure of mono-metallic actinide (An) complexes. Unprecedented physical properties have
been observed in AnTM alloys, but the insolubility of the later has prevented detailed studies, which will
be reflected by this research. The more covalent TMs are generally better at sharing and delocalizing
electrons, while the more ionic rare earths typically exhibit highly localized electrons. Using a molecular
platform of small cluster complexes with three or four metals, the electronic communication and f-
electron (de)localization for homometallic U or Pu clusters will be examined. Study of analogous
heterometallic Ti- U and Ti-Pu compounds will give insight to An-TM interactions. Direct TM-An and An-
An interactions are poorly understood. Studying intra-metal interactions gives insight to energy
generation, nuclear fuel cycle efficiency, and better catalyst design.

Luminosity Maximization with Flat Hadron Beams
Dr. Derong Xu, Assistant
Scientist Electron-Ion Collider
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton, NY 11973
The US Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) has been approved by the Department of Energy as the next
major scientific facility. The EIC to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will serve as an
ultimate electron microscope to probe the detailed physics inside the nucleus. The success of a collider is
measured by its luminosity, which quantifies the number of physics events generated during collisions.
The EIC plans to achieve high luminosity by utilizing a flat hadron beam, aligning it with the electron beam
to enhance interactions. However, a flat hadron beam has never been demonstrated in a real machine.
Maintaining a flat hadron beam presents challenges. The phenomenon of emittance growth and coupling
can result in an increase in the vertical size of the beam, ultimately causing the flat hadron beam to
become disrupted. This project focuses on investigating factors that can cause emittance growth and
coupling in a hadron storage ring, specifically looking at intra-beam scattering, magnet non-linearity, and
beam-beam interaction. By conducting experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and
developing a powerful simulation code, researchers aim to better understand and control these
phenomena. The insights gained from this project have the potential to improve the design and operation
of future colliders and advance simulation tools for scientific research.

A Programming Framework for Large-Scale Graph Data Analytics on GPUs and New AI Accelerators
Dr. Da Yan, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
University of Alabama at
Birmingham Birmingham, AL 35294
Graph-theoretic algorithms and graph machine learning models are essential tools for addressing many
real-life problems, including scientific ones such as bioinformatics, genomics, climate science, and
combustion science. DOE's Office of Science has prior investments in large-scale graph analytics such as
the EDGAR and ExaGraph projects, and the CSCAPES institute, but these efforts aimed at isolated tools
for a limited number of graph analytic algorithms. In contrast, this ECRP project aims to develop a
general programming framework called Graph4All that (1) makes it easy to implement various graph-
theoretic algorithms and graph machine learning models, and that (2) scales well with computing
resources including GPUs and AI accelerators invested in by DOE in recent years for supercomputing.
This is especially important to fully unleash the supercomputing power at DOE, such as the GPU-rich
supercomputers and ALCF AI testbed.
There are, however, challenges in implementing such a programming framework since graph algorithms
are inherently heterogeneous. We identify three categories of graph operations frequently used in a real
graph analytics pipeline: (1) vertex analytics, (2) structure analytics, and (3) graph machine learning.
These operations are often related and used together in a graph analytics pipeline. Currently, the think-
like-a-vertex (TLAV) computing model dominates the market of graph-parallel systems, but they are
inefficient for structure analytics. Moreover, there lacks a TLAV system that effectively utilizes sparse-
matrix-based operations on GPUs to speed up graph computation. The PI pioneered a new think-like-a-
task (TLAT) computing model for structure analytics, but the model relies on backtracking search which
is not suitable for GPU execution. Industrial systems for training big graph neural networks (GNNs) are
based on cloud infrastructures rather than GPU supercomputers, and they are still diverged in the
design choices.
Graph4All will be general by providing convenient programming models such as TLAV, TLAT and
aggregate-update for users to write their parallel graph algorithms easily, and run at scale efficiently on
GPU supercomputers and new AI accelerators. The software stack of Graph4All will follow a layered
design to maximize module reuse. The technical merit and novelty of Graph4All are: (i) Graph4All aims
to become a unified programming framework for heterogeneous graph operations in all types of vertex
analytics, structure analytics, and graph machine learning, where each graph operation can be
implemented with its most proper programming model to maximize out the efficiency on CPUs, GPUs
and new AI hardware. (ii) Graph4All addresses the challenge of adapting backtracking-based TLAT
systems for GPU execution, by designing a new GPU-efficient subgraph-extension execution framework
that operates on subgraphs. To address the challenge that GPUs have limited global memory while
subgraph extension may generate huge numbers of intermediate subgraphs, advanced techniques are
designed including chunking with a dynamic chunk size adjustment strategy, and expansion-prefix
sharing to reduce the redundant space and computation. A hybrid CPU-GPU computation solution will
be explored to utilize both CPUs and GPUs. (iii) hardware-efficient execution methods will be designed
for the TLAV computing model, such as GPU execution based on SpGEMM, and tensor-algebra
formulation for execution on new AI hardware. (iv) GPU-efficient distributed GNN training methods will
be designed to minimize data transmission and maximize efficiency, with techniques such as hybrid
model parallelism + data parallelism, vertex embedding caching with bounded staleness, mini-batch
sampling, and subgraph partition shrinking with GNN layer number. Distributed GNN inference will also
be optimized using machine learning compilation. (v) The project will explore graph compression and
gradient compression techniques, graph visualization functionalities based on WebGPU, and a topology-
aware communication scheduling.
Graph4All will have significant and broad impact since (i) it will be the first comprehensive and unified
framework supporting all operations in vertex analytics, structure analytics, and graph machine learning,
which are frequently needed to work together in a graph processing pipeline, (ii) it will be the first
comprehensive framework supporting these operations on GPU supercomputers, (iii) as a software
infrastructure, its programmability and extensibility will significantly speed up graph-parallel research in
ASCR area, especially facilitating the use of GPU supercomputers and new AI hardware, (iv) the tools
developed on top of Graph4All will allow domain scientists to conveniently customize and combine
them to conduct flexible graph analysis pipeline, to speed up scientific discovery with minimal efforts.

Interactions of QDs‚Äô Fast Light in Rb Vapors for Hybrid
Quantum Information Science and Technology
Dr. Joanna M Zajac, Staff Scientist
Instrumentation Division
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton, NY 11789
One of the fundamental challenges towards implementing scalable Quantum Information Science and
Technology (QIST) systems is to distribute entanglement in a fast and reliable way. To achieve this, key
developments are required, mainly, quantum light sources emitting identical single photons at
telecommunication wavelengths, and stationary-to-flying qubit interconnects. This project addresses
these challenges by developing fast light-matter interconnects made of alkali atomic ensembles and
quantum dots (QDs) single photons. This hybrid system combines advantages of the long coherence
times and ease of operation of alkali memories with excellent light emission properties of self-
assembled semiconductor QDs. To enable these and address current limitation of QDs technology, we
will co-design photon sources to be suitable to work at telecommunication and atomic wavelengths.
Additionally, we will engineer devices to ensure spectral and bandwidth tunability of the fast photons.
We will then investigate the interaction of the co-designed fast photons with atomic vapors
theoretically and experimentally, using quantum optical techniques, such as time-resolved
interferometry and spectroscopy. This project will bring fundamental understanding of interactions
between fast photons and atomic vapors that can be used for QIST applications in quantum-secure
communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum sensing.

Multiscale Ecosystem for Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics
Dr. Yu Zhang, Scientist 2
Theoretical Division
Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos, NM, 87545
The control of chemistry and molecular properties with light has been a long-standing Holy Grail for
decades. Only recently, new possibilities have emerged with polariton chemistry, where quasiparticles
known as polaritons form due to strong coupling between molecules and the quantized radiation field
inside an optical cavity. Theoretical investigations, especially on-the-fly simulations of polariton dynamics,
are essential to understand the underlying mechanisms and universal features of such hybrid light-mater
systems. However, the complexity of these systems, marked by multiple coherent and dissipative
interactions across different time and length scales, makes modeling a significant challenge. In response
to this multiscale challenge, we propose to develop a comprehensive, scalable multiscale ecosystem
bridging quantum optics, computational electromagnetics, and quantum chemistry. The aim is to deliver
advanced multiscale modeling capabilities for describing self-consistent interactions in light-mater hybrid
systems within the rigorous framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics on DOE exascale
computers. We plan to create a modular and scalable package, facilitating transferability to any new
hardware without extensive recoding and allowing for easy inclusion of new advancements. Such
developments will leverage our experiences developing nonadiabatic dynamics, exascale computing,
multiscale modeling, molecular quantum electrodynamics theory, and high-performance computing
facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Envisioned applications to molecular systems such as organic
donor-acceptor aggregates will demonstrate the ability to steer fundamental energy and charge transport
processes and modify the outcome of photochemical reactions. The successful completion of this project
will substantially enhance current theoretical and modeling capabilities for polariton chemistry. It will
move beyond widely used approximations, ensuring self-consistency between light and mater, deepening
our understanding of recent experiments in cavity-modified chemistry, and facilitating the design of
innovative materials through strong light-mater coupling. Moreover, the developed multiscale modeling
can be applied to broader light-mater interaction problems (such as plasmon chemistry, light-control of
quantum transport, and photon-mediated information transfer/transduction), benefiting fields such as
chemistry, physics, materials, energy, and quantum information science.

Using Kilometer-Scale E3SM to Investigate Air Pollution Impacts on Coastal Storms
Dr. Youtong Zheng, Assistant Professor
Department of Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences University of Houston
Houston, TX
Coastal urban communities face a significant threat from the combined forces of air pollution and
coastal storms. There is an ongoing debate among scientists regarding the potential link between
human- generated air pollution and the intensification of storms. This phenomenon, known as the
aerosol invigoration effect, has the potential to wreak havoc on our coastal urban areas, putting
economies and properties at risk. Unfortunately, current global climate models cannot represent this
effect due to the coarse grid resolution that fails to capture the intricate details of storm dynamics and
microphysics. With advancements in computational power, a new generation of climate models has
emerged, allowing for more detailed and accurate simulations at the kilometer scale. One such model is
the DOE's Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM). Motivated by this new
opportunity, this project plans to use SCREAM within a hierarchical modeling framework to assess the
magnitude of the aerosol invigoration effect on coastal storms and gain a mechanistic understanding of
the impacts. To that end, a series of observation-informed numerical experiments will be performed to
evaluate the fidelity of the SCREAM in reproducing observed coastal storms, elucidate the physical
mechanisms behind the invigoration effect, and examine how large-scale dynamics modulate this
phenomenon. These modeling activities will improve the predictability of coastal-urban systems by (1)
advancing fundamental understanding of air pollution impacts on coastal storms and (2) establishing a
well-tested analysis framework for guiding the development of DOE high-resolution models.

Imaging Emergent Phenomena in Two-Dimensional Magnets Using Single-Spin Quantum Microscope
Dr. Brian Zhou, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Boston College,
Chestnut Hill, MA 02467
In the last few decades, unprecedented progress has been made in controlling the quantum coherence of
single electrons or atoms, and moreover in observing the quantum correlations between them. These
advances present opportunities for a new era of ‚Äúquantum sensors‚Äù that exploit the extreme sensitivity
of electron states to their environment, achieving resolutions that are ultimately limited by the duration
with which such states can remain quantum coherent or by the number of such states that can be
entangled. The objective of this research project is to leverage the exceptional attributes of the nitrogen-
vacancy (NV) center in diamond, possessing a coherent single electron spin in a robust solid-state form
factor, for the high-resolution and high-sensitivity magnetic imaging of novel material samples. A unifying
theme is to transcend now well-established measurements of static magnetizations in single two-
dimensional materials by exploring emergent magnetic phenomena that arise under nonequilibrium
optical excitation or through superconducting proximity effects and twist engineering. The project will
identify novel, energy-efficient mechanisms to toggle magnetic devices through a unique pump-probe
optical platform. In addition, it will address key questions on the reproducibility of exotic transport
phenomena through the NV center‚Äôs capability to resolve micro to nanoscale inhomogeneity, extricate
current flow from static magnetization, and operate with continuous field and temperature tuning. More
broadly, the project will advance measurement schemes to expand the scope of applicability of NV
magnetometry to condensed mater systems and contribute to the preparation of a trained workforce at
the forefront of technological progress.

Quantum transducers enable the conversion of quantum information and signals between different
physical platforms. In the field of sensing, microwave-optical quantum transducers are particularly
significant in expanding the capabilities of superconducting quantum sensors, as they combine the
strengths of microwave and optical photons. This research program will significantly improve the
bidirectional conversion efficiency between microwave and optical fields, advancing quantum sensors and
distributed sensor networks for dark mater searches and addressing technological requirements for
fundamental physics experiments, including counting single photons and amplification without adding
noise. To accomplish these objectives, novel techniques utilizing hybrid platforms are envisioned. These
platforms integrate quantum devices based on superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities with very
long photon lifetime and electro-optic converters. Extensive simulations and analyses demonstrate that
this approach can achieve high conversion efficiency while operating at the quantum threshold. This work
will significantly enhance the sensitivity of dark mater searches, including axion-to-photon conversion
(haloscope) experiments, by converting microwave signals into optical photons and improving single-
photon detection beyond the limitations of the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). The outcome of this
research will have broader applications across various scientific fields and will impact critical areas such
as national security and quantum communication.

Ultrafast Mechanisms of Chirality Control in Electronic Materials
Dr. Michael Zuerch, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of California, Berkeley
Berkeley, CA 94720
Exploring and controlling the chiral properties of materials through light-mater interactions represents a
critical frontier in materials research. Chiral phases, characterized by distinct left or right-handed states,
hold tremendous potential for transformative applications in fields such as optoelectronics and quantum
technologies. Chirality can be understood as a property that distinguishes an object from its mirror image,
much like our hands. For example, a chiral molecule or material cannot be superimposed onto its mirror
image. This research aims to understand and manipulate chiral order that emerges in several quantum
materials with diverse structures and length scales. By employing advanced techniques such as extreme-
ultraviolet ultrafast spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction, we will investigate the emergence,
stabilization, and dynamics of chiral order during and following light-mater interaction. This research
harbors tremendous potential for scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements. By
unraveling non-equilibrium chiral states, we will gain profound insights into the structure-function
relationship of chiral quantum materials. The findings will pave the way for innovative applications,
including optically rewritable non-volatile memories and energy-efficient computation units based on
switching chiral order operating at high speeds, surpassing conventional electronics. Moreover, our
investigations into chiral dynamics and the emergence of order in materials with varying length scales will
drive the exploration of tailored chiral material systems to meet specific technological demands.
