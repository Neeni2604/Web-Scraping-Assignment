Construction of a Background Free, Normal-Ordering Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Demonstrator
Dr. Corey Adams, Assistant Physicist
Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
The experimental quest for the neutrino’s true nature, a search dating back to the earliest days
of nuclear and particle physics, is now harnessing experiments, machines, and detectors of high
precision and massive scale. Observation of a hypothesized unbelievably rare occurrence – a
neutrinoless double beta decay of a nucleus -- would indicate that a neutrino is its own antiparticle, and
would help to answer fundamental questions about why there is more matter than antimatter in the
Universe. Current and planned experiments will only be able to explore certain theories of neutrinoless
double beta decay due to coincidental but rare background (i.e., non-signal) data coming from
detectors. To fully resolve whether a nucleus can undergo this as-of-yet undetected reaction will
require new breakthroughs in detector technology that can reach the elusive “normal ordering”
neutrinoless double beta decay regime by eliminating background events. This research program will
unify and incorporate the latest developments in nuclear physics R&D into a novel detector capable of
demonstrating background-free searches for neutrinoless double beta decay. Notably, this will include
sensors capable of detecting, at the single-ion level, Barium++ ions as they are produced by double beta
decay in Xenon. Additionally, this detector will synthesize direct ultraviolet light collection and fast
optical cameras to enable high resolution, 3D imaging of neutrinoless double beta decay events.
Achieving background-free neutrinoless double beta decay searches will enable the Office of Science’s
high-priority search for neutrinoless double beta decay to reach unprecedented levels of sensitivity.

Intelligent Primitives for Scalable Graph Analytics and Learning
Dr. Ariful Azad, Assistant Professor
Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering
Indiana University
Bloomington, IN 47401
Interactions among entities drive almost all physical, social, and cyber-physical systems on
earth. A graph mathematically models an interacting system where a set of vertices represents entities
and a set of edges represents their interactions. Since many scientific datasets in chemical, biological,
and climate sciences are conveniently modeled as graphs, there is an undeniable need for high-
performance and general-purpose graph analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms and libraries
across DOE's scientific domains. The convergence of graph ML methods and domain sciences faces the
twin challenges of the diversity of scientific data and the heterogeneity of cyberinfrastructure. We aim
to address such challenges by mapping graph algorithms to a handful of intelligent computational
kernels that learn from data sparsity and hardware configurations. Relying on the message passing
paradigm, we will map many graph ML algorithms to sparse linear algebra operations for which we will
develop autotuned and communication-avoiding algorithms that can scale to millions of threads,
analyze graphs with trillions of edges, and exhibit portable performance on various computing
platforms. This project will also develop flexible and interpretable algorithms for graph embedding and
graph neural networks that in turn rely on our intelligent primitives for performance. We will use these
algorithms and libraries to solve exascale problems from metagenomics, scientific computing,
visualization, and graph machine learning. Thus, this project aims to develop algorithmic foundations for
scalable, portable, and usable graph ML algorithms and libraries.

Computationally Driven Design and Synthesis for Electron Transfer Materials
based on Nonnatural Polymers
Dr. Marcel D. Baer, Senior Research Scientist
Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99352
Developing new materials that exhibit control over electron transfer processes is necessary to
address challenges in energy production and storage. Nature provides a blueprint for achieving this
control through use of protein machinery evolved from archaic modules of small proteins that carry out
coupled oxidation and reduction — or redox — reactions. Electrons are transferred from one module to
the next within this machinery, with each module containing one or more redox centers. Control is
achieved by the sequence of redox centers whose potentials are defined by the local environment within
the protein. However, efforts to harness the complex functionality of Nature’s modular material design
for energy technologies must address the challenge of operating under harsh non-biological conditions.
Recent synthetic advances now enable design and synthesis of nanostructured materials from nonnatural,
sequence-defined polymers that mimic proteins, but exhibit high stability in such conditions. The purpose
of this research is to develop the understanding of structure and function required to incorporate redox
centers that mimic the electron transfer function of natural proteins. The focus will be on computational
design of individual macromolecular units containing four iron ions and four sulfide ions placed at the
vertices of a cubane-type cluster, whose redox potentials are tunable through their local environment.
Methods to be used range from quantum to molecular mechanics and coarse grain simulations,
specifically as they relate to modeling nonnatural sequence defined polymers and their interactions with
redox clusters. Ultimately, these units may be arranged into materials mimicking Nature’s exquisite spatial
control of electron transfer under non-biological conditions to harness the complex functionality of
hierarchical matter.

Resolving the f-electron Challenge with Scanning Probe Microscopy/Spectroscopy
Dr. Miles F. Beaux II, Scientist 3
Materials Science and Technology Division
Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos, NM 87545
The ability to predict the chemical and physical properties of a material is directly related to the
structure and interactions of its electrons. For materials comprised of f-block elements (the lanthanides
and actinides found in the last two rows of the periodic table), the complexity of electronic structure has
presented great difficulty in understanding, modelling, and predicting material properties. For this reason,
resolving the f-electron challenge was identified by the Department of Energy’s Basic Energy Sciences
program as one of three Grand Challenges to be overcome in order to transform the scientific field. The
objectives of this proposed project are to probe the electronic structures of a series of single-crystal
actinide (An) carbide, nitride, oxide, and intermetallic samples using scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS) techniques. Specifically, neptunium (Np), plutonium (Pu), and americium (Am) are targeted due to
their unique location in the actinide series of elements, which straddle a transition from itinerant bonding
behavior, and localized non-bonding behavior. The instabilities in electronic structure that occur near this
transition are thought to be responsible for the complexity of material behaviors observed for derivative
compounds of these actinide elements. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on a range
of bulk single crystal actinide intermetallic compounds, a seamless mapping of both the occupied and
unoccupied electronic structures of these materials can be obtained using a local probe, providing a
means by which their complex chemical and physical properties can be understood. The results thus
obtained will be compared to mapping of the electronic structures in these materials obtained by other
methods, such as photoemission, X-ray absorption, and X-ray emission spectroscopies. Computational
modelling of the electronic structures of these materials will be used to correlate the surface electronic
states measured by STS, to bulk electronic states and bonding modes of molecular complexes with
analogous bonds relevant to Heavy Element Chemistry (HEC) research.

Hybrid Kinetic-Fluid Modeling of Tokamak Disruption Mitigation
Dr. Matthew T. Beidler, R&D Associate
Fusion Energy Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
A critical first step toward realizing abundant, carbon-free fusion energy is the self-sustaining,
burning plasma ITER experiment. Achieving ITER’s goals will require the avoidance or mitigation of
disruptions - a rapid loss of the plasma stored energy, and the subsequent runaway electrons - an
uncontrolled high-energy beam generated by the disruption. The prevailing mitigation strategy is to
rapidly inject additional material to trigger a controlled disruption and dissipate the resulting RE beam.
This strategy has proven successful on existing devices, but questions remain on how to optimize the
deployment for ITER and next step devices. This presents a clear need for validated predictive modeling
to inform mitigation strategies that retire the risks of disruptions and runaway electrons.
The goals of this project are to determine the efficacy of and recommend optimizations for the
disruption and runaway electron mitigation system planned for ITER and future reactors. While fluid and
kinetic models have separately extended our understanding of disruptions and runaway electrons, less
progress has been made to understand their self-consistent, coupled dynamics. In particular, the coupled
dynamics are critical for modeling post-disruption, runaway electron generation and mitigation via
material injection, where runaway electrons carry the entire plasma current and significantly affect
material transport. The project goals will be achieved by developing a self-consistent coupling where fluid
fields are calculated simultaneously with the full distribution of kinetic runaway electron orbits. The
resulting tool will efficiently and rapidly assess the formation likelihood of runaway electrons and their
energy deposition onto the walls of the device to develop practical disruption and runaway electron
mitigation solutions.

Maximizing Dark Energy Constraints from Next Generation Cosmic Microwave Background Cluster
Surveys
Dr. Lindsey Bleem, Assistant Physicist
High Energy Physics
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Clusters of galaxies, the largest-gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, are powerful tools
with which to constrain cosmological models. Over the past decade, the field has been transformed by
the construction of the first cluster samples using data from high-resolution cosmic microwave
background (CMB) experiments in which these massive systems are detected via the subtle distortions
they imprint on the sky observed at millimeter wavelengths. Current and next generation CMB
experiments are poised to continue this revolution by enabling the discovery of 10,000 to 100,000 galaxy
clusters. These unprecedented cluster samples will provide critical clues into the nature of dark energy,
the mysterious phenomena driving the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. There are two
key requirements for studying dark energy with galaxy clusters: a census of these systems spanning cosmic
time and the ability to connect the observed properties of these systems to cosmological models. While
these requirements are easy to state, this cosmological census is extremely challenging, and numerous
problems remain to be solved to make full use of cluster samples for cosmology.
This Early Career program will address these challenges through an observation- and simulation-
based effort focused on obtaining cosmological constraints with a new cluster sample from SPT-3G, an
ongoing CMB survey being conducted by the 10 m South Pole Telescope. The close coupling of data and
simulation efforts in this program will be critical for achieving tight control over the measurement and
modeling biases that currently limit cluster cosmology. The tools developed in this program will enable a
significant improvement in cosmological constraints from the SPT-3G dataset, and—perhaps more
critically in this era where systematic uncertainties are coming to dominate error budgets over statistical
uncertainties—are designed to ensure that these constraints are unbiased. This work will prepare us to
leverage the full power of the upcoming cluster samples from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and CMB-S4 surveys, and thus help to maximize the impact of DOE’s
investment in these world-class cosmic surveys.

Machine learning approaches for spherical tokamak scenario optimization and real-time control
Dr. Mark D. Boyer II, Staff Research Physicist
NSTX-U
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
Princeton, NJ 08540
The PI proposes to develop and demonstrate tools for using machine learning (ML) for
optimization of Spherical Tokamak (ST) plasmas and to establish the basis for extending these tools to
real-time control of STs. ML algorithms will be used to obtain accelerated simulation capabilities suitable
for optimizing actuator trajectories to achieve high performance scenarios. Algorithms for calculating
proximity to machine limits and disruptions will ensure trajectories maintain a safe distance from these
limits.
While the small size of STs makes efficient use of magnetic fields, it presents space constraints
that amplify the problem of handling heat loads and forces, and limits the size of coils for inductive plasma
current start up and sustainment. Disruptions compound the heat load and force problems, and strategies
to avoid and mitigate them as much as possible are necessary. These challenges make it critical to develop
novel tools for prediction, optimization, and active control that can accurately model the plasma response
to available actuators while identifying and avoiding machine limits and plasma disruptions. Recent
fundamental improvements in machine learning and in computing hardware provide the opportunity to
integrate physics modeling and empirical data to make accurate and fast predictions, and to develop rapid
optimization algorithms for offline and real-time use. These tools, which will be explored in this work,
could have a transformative effect on real-time plasma control and scenario development. The sub-tasks
of this project will include:
1. Rapid simulations using ML: Machine learning surrogates for high-fidelity physics models will
be used
to accelerate calculations while maintaining high-fidelity. For quantities that are not accurately modeled
by available physics models, experimental data will be used to train machine learning models.
2. ML identification of proximity to machine limits, disruptions, and other events: ML algorithms
will be used to generate estimates of the safe operating space, free of disruptions and other deleterious
events. The identified constraints bounding the safe operating region will be in a form appropriate for
use in optimization algorithms.
3. Optimization of actuator trajectories: The rapid, accurate simulation capabilities and the
estimates of safe operating space developed in the first two subtasks will enable application of numerical
optimization techniques to design actuator trajectories.
4. Implementation of algorithms for control room use: The models and algorithms developed in
the first three subtasks will be implemented for control room (between shots) use. As part of this effort,
techniques for adapting trained models to newly acquired data will be developed, as well as active
learning approaches that will help guide the design of experiments and simulations to simultaneously
improve the ML predictive models and ST performance.

The Role of Local Chemical Order on Defect Kinetics in Alloys under Irradiation
Dr. Penghui Cao, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
University of California, Irvine
Irvine, CA 92697
As an emerging class of materials, multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have attracted
increasing attention owing to their extraordinary properties, including diminished radiation defects,
enhanced swelling resistance, and suppressed solute segregation when compared to traditional solid
solutions. While the fundamental atomic mechanisms and their correlation to the improved radiation
performance remain to be elucidated, this project speculates that the hidden local chemical order may be
the salient feature that makes MPEAs distinct from traditional alloys, plays a vital role in radiation defect
dynamics and kinetics, and contributes to the improved radiation tolerance. The overarching goal of this
research is to understand the role of local chemical order on the kinetics of defects in MPEAs under
irradiation and to evaluate the mechanistic strategy for controlling radiation defects migration and
evolution through tailoring the degree of local ordering at the nanoscale. The research focuses on single-
phase MPEAs and addresses the following fundamental questions regarding local ordering: (i) how does
the local chemical order influence defect migration, coalescence, and growth; (ii) what are the new
atomistic mechanisms and processes enabled by local order that could lead to radiation damage
reduction; and (iii) is tuning the degree of local ordering able to promote defect recombination and to
alleviate radiation-induced damage accumulation? Specifically, research activities are driven by three
mechanistic hypotheses pertaining to the role of local ordering on point defects, defect clusters, and grain
boundaries: (1) the presence of local chemical order raises migration energy barriers of point defects and
localizes their diffusion; a localized diffusion can promote defects recombination and mitigate defect
cluster growth; (2) local chemical order roughens the potential energy landscape, which can locally pin a
dislocation loop and reduce its diffusivity; and (3) the introduced local ordering in the grain matrix
increases grain boundary migration energy and lowers its mobility. These hypotheses will be evaluated in
single-phase MPEAs using integrated theoretical and computational techniques, including molecular
dynamics, Monte Carlo, accelerated molecular dynamics, climbing image nudged elastic band method,
and a machine learning tool. The modeling and theoretical predictions will be validated by targeted
experiments, including energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy characterization and in-situ ion irradiation.
Evaluation of these hypotheses will advance the fundamental understanding of atomistic mechanisms
underlying the extraordinary properties of MPEAs, facilitate material design strategies to manipulate
defect behaviors via tailoring nanoscale features, and result in tunable material properties.

Towards Robust Cosmology from Large-Scale Structure with Galaxy Surveys
Dr. Chihway Chang
Clare Booth Luce Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics
Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
University of Chicago
Chicago, IL 60637
Cosmology is at an exciting crossroads. Over the last two decades, through a variety of observations, we
have put together a standard model of cosmic evolution, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model,
that provides an excellent description of the evolution of the Universe and the structures within it.
Recently, however, we are seeing mild tensions in LCDM preferred by the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments (a probe of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang) and by galaxy
surveys (a probe of the Universe 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang). This research focuses on
rigorously addressing this issue for galaxy surveys, as we prepare for the next transformative leap in
statistical power coming from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a DOE
and National Science Foundation (NSF) partnership. Together with collaborators in the LSST Dark Energy
Science Collaboration (DESC), the research team will first complete and validate the LSST cosmology
pipelines combining weak lensing and galaxy clustering using simulations. Next the project will re-
analyze Stage-III galaxy surveys using this pipeline and combine them together. The results of this
analysis will guide our focus for the next decade of dark energy experiments. It will also serve as a
critical bridge between Stage-III (Dark Energy Survey) and Stage-IV (LSST) galaxy surveys for transferring
knowledge and tools associated with large-scale structure cosmology analyses.

Development of PFIB-Xray System with Machine Learning Method
to Realize Comprehensive Analysis from Macro- to Nano-scale
Dr. Si Chen, Physicist
X-ray Science Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Many scientific questions in materials and biological sciences center around the relationship
between hierarchical structures and macroscale functional performance, requiring a unique
characterization platform for linking chemical, structural, and functional properties across all relevant
length scales. The upcoming upgrade of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) will enable the development
of hard x-ray nanoprobes approaching <10 nm spatial resolution. However, upscaling nanoimaging to
examine samples beyond the microscopic scale faces many intrinsic challenges. This project will directly
address these challenges by developing a Xenon plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) -Xray instrument with
associated data analysis methods. The instrument combines an x-ray nanoimaging system and a PFIB
probe to allow in-situ sample manipulation to facilitate and optimize x-ray imaging from macro- to nano-
scale on one integrated platform. Novel data analysis including machine learning methods will be
developed to correlate data collected at different scales and extract critical scientific information. With
this new technique, one will be able to perform analysis across scales from the level of a functional device
to single grains or deeply buried interfaces. A new landscape of scientific applications will be enabled
including investigation of performance degradation at various structural levels of perovskite solar cells,
multiscale characterization of additively manufactured alloys, imaging of microbe dynamics in
undisturbed soil aggregates, and mapping of hierarchical structures in bones or biological tissues. The
development of the PFIB-Xray will take advantage of the upcoming APS Upgrade, and in turn fully realize
its potential for hard x-ray microscopy.

Defining the influence of environmental stress on bioenergy feedstocks at single-cell resolution
Dr. Benjamin J. Cole, Research Scientist
DOE-Joint Genome Institute
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
Plant biomass from bioenergy crops is an important resource that enhances energy
independence and promotes good environmental stewardship. Environmental stresses such as drought
or nutrient deficiency hinder optimal performance of these crops. Therefore, the development of new
strategies to improve plant biomass production will require a better understanding of how plants
tolerate and respond to environmental stress. Plant responses to drought are complex and involve the
coordinated action of many different types of cells with specialized functions. For example, cells that
compose stomata (pores in the leaf that open and close to exchange carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water
vapor) may respond very differently to drought than cells of the plant vasculature. The objective of this
project is to use innovative technologies to measure how individual cells respond to drought and
nutrient limitation in two prominent bioenergy crops, sorghum and switchgrass. This will require the
construction of large, curated datasets detailing the regulation of genes in hundreds of thousands of
individual plant cells. In addition, the planned research will analyze gene expression under drought and
nutrient stress using sophisticated plant growth chambers that closely mimic agricultural field
conditions. Lastly, this project will investigate the impact of beneficial soil microorganisms on plant
growth under stress. The results of this research will significantly advance our foundational knowledge
of how plants coordinate their responses to environmental stresses and will ultimately enable us to
target genes in specific cells for crop improvement.

Resonant Coherent Diffractive Imaging of Quantum Solids
Dr. Riccardo Comin, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
Electronic symmetry breaking is at the heart of many forms of collective phenomena in quantum
solids, including superconductivity, magnetism, and density waves. The inherent competition between
these electronic phases and their interplay with disorder often lead to a highly textured landscape across
multiple length scales. Visualizing these nanoscale textures is a modern challenge and key to a
fundamental understanding of quantum matter, but it suffers from a lack of tailored probes. This research
project will address this critical need by combining advanced X-ray coherent (‘lensless’) imaging methods
and resonant soft X-ray scattering into an integrated Resonant Coherent Diffractive Imaging toolset. The
main goal is to study the nanoscale organization of quantum phases of matter at length scales between
10 nanometers and 10 microns. These complex spatial textures will be investigated in quantum solids
with different forms of collective phenomena: copper oxides and transition metal tellurides
(superconductivity and charge-density-waves); rare earth nickelates and van der Waals magnets
(antiferromagnetism); and artificial magnets with complex spin textures (skyrmions). Thanks to recent
advances in highly coherent X-ray sources, the development of new multiscale imaging techniques is
timely and poised to significantly advance our understanding of collective phenomena in complex
systems. Looking beyond the horizon of quantum materials, the availability of new coherent X-ray imaging
methods provides potentially transformative opportunities for the characterization of a broad class of
functional materials (catalysts, batteries, magnetic devices), soft matter, and biological systems.

Measuring Key Nuclear Reactions for the Weak r-process
Dr. Melina Avila Coronado, Assistant Physicist
Physics Division
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Where do heavy elements—those heavier than iron, such as gold and europium—come from?
For decades, this question has been the subject of intense debate among physicists. The recent first-
ever observation of two binary neutron stars colliding and merging suggests that these mergers are
responsible for the production of heavy elements via the rapid neutron capture process (r-process).
However, observations of ultra-metal-poor stars show that this is not the whole story. Rather, there is
strong evidence that there is another r-process site that produces the lightest heavy elements—from
strontium to silver—attributable to the r-process. Neutrino-driven winds that follow core-collapse
supernova explosions are possible candidates for the production of the weak r-process elements, but
unfortunately, none of the relevant reaction rates necessary to constrain astrophysical models are
experimentally known. Obtaining direct measurements of these reactions is experimentally challenging
because they require unstable neutron-rich beams, which are usually produced at low intensities. The
goal of this project is to develop innovative methods of measuring reaction rates important for the
production of weak r-process elements, building on a technique recently developed at Argonne National
Laboratory’s tandem linac accelerator system (ATLAS) for the direct measurement of nuclear reactions
using neutron-rich beams. With the development of a powerful active-target detector—a time-
projection chamber with three-dimensional tracking and high-rate capabilities—and the implementation
of machine learning techniques for data analysis, this research will reduce or remove some of the most
important nuclear physics uncertainties associated with the weak r-process and will substantially
improve our understanding of nucleosynthesis from neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae.

In-Beam Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy at the Limits of FRIB
Dr. Heather Crawford, Staff Scientist
Nuclear Science Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
An area of great discovery potential at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will be at the
neutron driplines, the upper mass limit of existence for each isotope on the periodic table. In this
region, the imbalance of neutrons and protons in the nucleus results in the evolution of proton and
neutron orbitals, the emergence of collective structure, and the potential for changes in nuclear
properties due to the proximity of unbound configurations. The study of nuclei close to the neutron
dripline is particularly interesting; these nuclei play a strong role in isotope production in stars and their
structure also informs nuclear theory. Establishing how and when large neutron-to-proton ratios in a
nucleus require new or modified theoretical tools is a major question in nuclear physics that remains
largely unanswered. To move the science forward, data as close to the reachable limits of experiment
are essential, requiring targeted measurements and new experimental capabilities. The goal of this
research is the study of nuclear structure at the limits of existence through a program of strategic
measurements at FRIB. Measurements will focus on the most exotic magnesium, calcium and iron
nuclei. In parallel, a thick liquid hydrogen target coupled with charged particle detectors for reaction
vertex reconstruction will be developed and deployed to maximize sensitivity for spectroscopy
measurements at FRIB.

Understanding the Effects of Populus—Mycorrhizal Associations on Plant Productivity and Resistance
to Abiotic Stress
Dr. Melissa A. Cregger, Staff Scientist
Biosciences Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
Harnessing plant–microbial interactions that occur in bioenergy crop plantations provides an
opportunity to create sustainable, multipurpose bioeconomies. In these plantations, globally important
biofuel feedstocks can be produced while simultaneously maximizing soil health and mitigating adverse
impacts on climate. Over the past two decades, it has become increasingly clear that interactions between
plants and microorganisms alter the way in which plants grow and respond to environmental stress. These
interactions have been coined “plant holobionts,” which are biological units consisting of the plant host
plus all of the symbiotic microorganisms associated with the plant. To increase sustainability within
biofeedstock plantations, this research is focused on building optimal plant holobionts between
biofeedstock trees within the genus Populus and fungi that form symbiotic associations (mycorrhizae)
with the trees’ roots. This will be accomplished by identifying high-performing varieties of Populus species
and hybrids that are resistant to drought and pairing them with diverse mycorrhizal consortia. This work
will examine the ecosystem-level consequences of these assembled Populus holobionts to understand
how manipulating those interactions influences nutrient cycling and carbon storage in a Populus tree
plantation. Furthermore, this project will establish a unique collection of plant, microbial, and common
garden resources that can be leveraged to engineer the next generation of bioenergy crops.

Architecting the Hardware-Software Interface for Neuromorphic Computers
Dr. Anup K. Das, Assistant Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Drexel University
Philadelphia, PA 19104
Neuromorphic computers are emerging computing systems that operate on the principles of the
central nervous system. They implement neurons and synapses in hardware, supporting biology-inspired
synaptic plasticity. These systems can perform several different types of scientific computations with
significantly lower energy footprints compared to a conventional CPU-based computer. Future high-
performance neuromorphic computers are expected to aggregate multiple heterogeneous neuromorphic
hardware nodes to solve scientific computations that are far too complex for single-node hardware.
Despite the progress made on the hardware and technology fronts, the software stacks for these
computers have remained largely unexplored. As a result, even a small neuromorphic computer, where
neurons and synapses are in the millions, requires an enormous amount of time and expertise to program
and visualize results. This complex interface is expected to become a programming bottleneck for systems
that can have several orders more neurons and synapses than today’s systems. Therefore, there remains
a pressing need to architect the hardware-software interface such that these high-performance systems
can easily be integrated into the existing workflow at different United States Department of Energy (DOE)
Office of Science national laboratories. To address this need, the research will develop virtualization of
neuromorphic computers, abstracting the application developers, i.e., the users from the underlying
hardware. Specific objectives of this research include 1) hardware-software co-design of the virtual
machine interface for neuromorphic computers, 2) managing resources and memory for virtual machines
invoked on a neuromorphic computer, 3) supporting concurrent applications with custom priority and
security policies, and 4) mitigating security vulnerabilities through application isolation. The proposed
research activities will make neuromorphic computers programmable, secure, efficient, and easy-to-use
for the broader scientific community of DOE.

Scalable Dynamic Scientific Data Reduction
Dr. Sheng Di, Computer Scientist
Mathematics and Computer Science
Argonne National Laboratory
Lemont, IL 60439
Lossy compression is critical to the success of today's and future scientific discovery because of
the extreme volumes of data produced by scientific applications or instruments. Existing error-bounded
lossy compressors, however, suffer from two significant drawbacks: (1) they support only simple error
controlling (such as absolute error bound) that does not match the user's requirements for preserving
quantities of interest and features; and (2) existing general-purpose data compressors are developed
based on static designs without adaptability to the diverse characteristics of application datasets. The
overarching goal of this project is to develop a scalable dynamic scientific data reduction (SDR) framework
(and practical library/toolkit) that can automatically construct the best-qualified data reduction solution
in terms of user requirements and dynamic data characteristics, significantly improving data reduction
quality and performance over the existing general-purpose lossy compressors. Four critical thrusts will be
explored. (1) SDR will use numerical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning to optimize the specific
design for a broad range of data reduction techniques. (2) The project will explore efficient machine
learning based search algorithms to determine online the optimal data reduction solution (model and
parameters). (3) The project will explore how to satisfy user-requirements (fidelity, speed, reduction ratio)
efficiently and accurately. (4) SDR will support multiple parallel heterogeneous environments and will be
evaluated comprehensively by using diverse scientific applications on DOE leadership-class
supercomputers.

Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play an important role in the Earth’s energy balance and are
prolific rain producers in tropical and mid-latitude regions. The representation of DCCs and their
feedback on the global circulation and precipitation represents one of the greatest uncertainties in Earth
system models. Among all processes, the aerosol impacts on DCC properties remains particularly poorly
understood, limiting the predictability of climate and the water cycle. It has been hypothesized that
aerosols, tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere, can help strengthen or invigorate
convective storms. In this scenario, an increase in aerosol amount deepens the DCCs through
interactions with cloud and precipitation particles, changing the vertical profile of water phase changes
and the associated latent heating, which then increases the buoyancy of convective updrafts. A major
bottleneck has been the lack of key supporting observations of convective properties to provide clarity
of the invigoration processes. Furthermore, the fundamental causal relationships among the highly
nonlinear aerosol-DCC-environment interactions are difficult to resolve with traditional statistical
methods.
To bridge these critical knowledge gaps in aerosol-convection interactions, we propose a blended
observational-modeling framework. The framework combines advanced ground-based observations
from the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facilities, and satellite and reanalysis datasets with
innovative machine learning techniques, and high-resolution modeling. The standing hypothesis is that
high aerosol amounts promote stronger DCC up- and downdrafts, leading to more vigorous cloud
initiation along the convective downdraft boundaries and enhanced convective organization. To test this
hypothesis, the project will use several innovative concepts and methods including: (1) evaluation of
invigoration hypotheses using unique remote sensing measurements of convective up/downdraft
velocities, (2) determination of causal relationships among the aerosol-DCC-environment interactions
using a new causal inference framework, (3) identification of the environmental conditions favorable for
invigoration using machine learning techniques, and (4) exploration of the underlying invigoration
pathways by considering the three-way links between aerosols, the environment, and convective
strength through observation-informed high-resolution simulations.
The results from this project will resolve the debate regarding the magnitude and importance of aerosol
impacts on DCCs and determine drivers of the aerosol-DCC invigoration hypotheses. As a result, and
more fundamentally, the proposed activities will lead to improved understanding of fundamental DCC
processes for the improvement of the representation of DCC lifecycles in regional and global models and
of the water cycle predictability.

Adaptive Synthesis of Nanoporous Membranes by Pathway Directed Self-Assembly
Dr. Gregory Doerk, Staff Scientist
Center for Functional Nanomaterials
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton, NY 11973
A new generation of higher performance separation membranes will be critical to ensuring the
water, energy, and economic security of the United States in the 21st century. The self-assembly of
polymers and other nanomaterials presents an approach to synthesize membranes with tailored
nanopore architectures that achieve remarkable improvements in separation performance; however,
economically viable strategies for membrane manufacturing by self-assembly have yet to be realized.
Directing self-assembly at or near equilibrium can ensure ideal membrane characteristics at the cost of
manufacturing scalability. Meanwhile, nonequilibrium solvent-nonsolvent exchange processes for self-
assembled membrane fabrication are readily scaled up yet remain extremely challenging to economically
optimize. To address this scalability challenge, this research project pursues a transformative synthesis
strategy of pathway directed self-assembly, in which industrially scalable processes are rationally
designed to follow specific nonequilibrium pathways for the self-assembly of membranes that meet
functional design targets. Three specific objectives will be pursued to demonstrate this concept: (1)
Analogues of conventional processes for deposition, solvent vapor treatment, and chemical infiltration of
soft matter thin films will be developed using ultrasonic spraying, a process already in use at
manufacturing scale. (2) Active spray control, real-time nanostructure characterization using synchrotron
X-rays, and closed-loop autonomous workflows will be combined to enable adaptive, feedback-controlled
spray process tuning. This capability will be used to efficiently survey myriad nonequilibrium assembly
pathways, including ones inaccessible through other processing methods. (3) Adaptive spray process
tuning will be applied to direct self-assembly pathways towards synthesis of fouling- and organic solvent-
resistant membranes with aligned, molecular-scale pores. The advances made in pursuit of these
objectives will yield fundamental clarity about nonequilibrium self-assembly processes and introduce a
powerful new adaptive synthesis capability to the benefit of Department of Energy facility users.

Exotic Probes of Dense Nuclear Matter

Energetic collisions of nuclei produce a unique phase of matter, called the quark-gluon plasma,
where normal particles like protons and neutrons melt down into their constituent parts. As this plasma
expands and cools, clusters of three quarks can freeze back into more familiar particles, while larger
groups of four, five, or more quarks can coalesce into exotic particles that are not well understood. The
rate at which exotic particles form is dependent on the properties of the plasma such as its temperature
and density, and also on the structure of the exotic particles themselves. The LHCb experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider is uniquely well suited to measure these exotic particles in a wide range of nuclear
environments. This project will use LHCb to measure exotic particles produced in both collider and
fixed-target collisions, where they will be exposed to different conditions. These measurements will
provide new information on the mechanisms by which quarks combine into particles and the
fundamentally allowed configurations of quarks that make up visible matter. In addition, these data will
be used to guide projections for future studies of exotic particle interactions at the forthcoming
Electron-Ion Collider.

Verification of Quantum Devices from Emergent Randomness
Dr. Manuel Endres, Assistant Professor of Physics
Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy
California Institute of Technology
Pasadena, CA 91125
As current quantum devices grow more complex, the question of verification becomes
increasingly important. Verification refers to tests carried out in order to ascertain how close a quantum
device is to its ideal performance limit. This is especially critical for quantum computing and simulation
architectures that are not yet error-corrected, which are often referred to as noisy intermediate scale
devices. A powerful, and currently leading, method for such verification is to implement a specialized
type of random evolution, which generates quantum states or operators that randomly fill the
associated state space. However, this type of evolution is not available on many types of quantum
devices, including most analog quantum simulators, which have been used to study outstanding
questions in quantum many-body physics. To solve this issue, we propose to make use of a very recent
and surprising observation: Viewed from the right perspective, generic chaotic many-body evolution will
produce randomly distributed quantum states, even without specialized control sequences. We call this
phenomenon emergent randomness. We propose to use emergent randomness as a widely available
tool for device verification, thereby generalizing existing protocols to a much broader class of quantum
devices as well as to shorter evolution times and illuminating the limitations of randomness-based
verification more generally.

Spacetime Emergence from Quantum Gravity: Perturbative and Nonperturbative Aspects
Dr. Netta Engelhardt, Assistant Professor of Physics
Center for Theoretical Physics
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
The black hole interior is one of the most mysterious and poorly understood phenomena of
modern physics, partly because it is simultaneously described by gravity and quantum mechanics. The
two theories, both of which have undergone rigorous empirical testing, disagree on a fundamental point:
whether information about the region behind the event horizon can escape and be decoded by an
observer outside of the black hole. The conflicting predictions are known as the Black Hole Information
Paradox, a foundational puzzle in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity: a theory that can
simultaneously describe the black hole interior and the dynamics of the big bang. In recent years, a
synergy of tools from quantum information theory and gravitational physics have catalyzed a new era of
progress on this paradox. This research project capitalizes on the interplay between gravitational
phenomena such as gravitational lensing and information theoretic input such as a quantification of the
computational complexity of quantum tasks. These connections will be used to both work towards a
resolution of the Information Paradox and to leverage this progress into new insights on the quantum
nature of spacetime.

Frontend Implementation of AI-Machine Learning Neural Networks for On-Detector Radiation-
Hard Edge Compute
Farah Fahim, Principal Engineer
Fermi Quantum Institute/ Particle Physics Division
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
Highly granular, large area sensors generate voluminous amounts of experimental data, while still
relying on increasingly inadequate conventional means of data transfer. Traditionally readout integrated
circuits (chips) are used to amplify the analog signal generated by sensors and convert it to digital signals.
Processing this data at the source, as close to the sensor as possible is more efficient than the transmission
of data across long networks to data centers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Machine Learning (ML) using deep
neural networks (NN) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for data compression, processing, and
analysis in various applications.
Efficiency is especially critical in High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) applications where both
power and bandwidth are extremely limited resources. Other challenges include real-time latency
constraints, operation in extreme radiation environments, and space limitations. Transforming raw data
into higher-level physics information by utilizing ML can result in a reduction of data transfer by orders of
magnitude.
Optimized AI instrumentation relies on co-design: the idea that system constraints, algorithm
development, and hardware implementation inform and guide each other in complementary ways. ML
uses large experimental data sets to create a model which excels in tasks requiring pattern recognition,
anomaly detection and prediction. The development of an on-chip, efficient AI implementation begins
with algorithm performance and design, tailored to the constraints of the system. While digital ML
processing can achieve data reduction, taking advantage of neuromorphic, mixed analog-digital signal
processing and in-memory compute techniques will enable super-efficient data processing. The objective
of this research program is to develop a hardware-software codesign methodology and demonstrate
novel detector instrumentation.

Cathode R&D for high intensity electron source in support of EIC
Dr. Mengjia Gaowei, Associate Scientist
Collider-Accelerator Department
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton, NY 11973
The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a unique high-energy, high-luminosity polarized collider
that will be one of the most challenging and exciting accelerator complexes ever built. The EIC will be a
discovery machine that collides electrons with protons and nuclei to produce snapshots of those particles’
internal structure. It will provide answers to the mysteries of matter related to our understanding the
origin of mass, structure, and binding of the atomic nuclei. To maintain a high luminosity in the EIC, it is
desirable to cool the hadron beams to improve the collision rate. Electron cooling is a promising technique
to achieve this goal. This technique requires an electron source that can continuously produce electron
beams with low emittance, high average current and high bunch charge. Multi-alkali antimonide
photocathodes have proven to be highly effective in meeting these challenges. This research is aiming at
growing nearly perfect crystals of alkali antimonides with assistance of a variety of characterization tools
and evaluate the performance of the bulk grown crystals as photocathodes. Further, the effort will test
these cathodes alongside traditionally grown cathodes for high current operation, both to evaluate
performance and to characterize failure mechanisms. These efforts are expected to lead to a dramatic
improvement of the material quantum efficiency (QE), with a goal of reproducible production of cathodes
with high operational QE and lifetimes at least twice that of traditional cathodes. Furthermore, this
research will explore and evaluate the various protective mechanisms brought up by the community in
recent years, including 2-D material encapsulation and nano-structure enhancement, under high current
operation conditions. The success of this work will yield the ideal photocathode material with better QE
and longer lifetime for high current applications for EIC. It has the potential to create both a scientific
breakthrough in understanding the properties of photocathode materials, and a technological
breakthrough in extending the operational lifetime of cathodes for electron coolers. Ultimately this will
improve luminosity and decrease downtime for the flagship machines in nuclear physics.

Prediction of Breakdown in Air and Solid Dielectrics:
A Complete Plasma Model from Discharge Initiation to Flashover
Dr. Mona Ghassemi, Assistant Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg, VA 24061
A major challenge for most of the present day technologies and the technologies of the future is
the compact and reliable design of insulation systems for their electrical components. Although controlled
low-temperature plasma or non-thermal plasma in air at atmospheric pressure are of interest for a variety
of technologies, a sudden occurrence of such plasma or discharge in an insulation system is highly
undesirable. Such discharges can lead to an electrical breakdown or flashover, resulting in a complete
failure of the insulation system. Currently, there is not a complete model of all the discharges that can
result in the breakdown of an insulation system. For non-thermal plasma, there have been studies that
focus on only one mechanism or just the transition from one discharge mechanism to another. For thermal
plasma, studies have also been done focused on just the conditions following the occurrence of an electric
arc or flashover. In both cases, a systematic study leading to a complete model comprising all discharge
mechanisms is missing. To address this gap, a complete plasma model for both thermal and non-thermal
plasmas will be developed using a hydrodynamic approach. The project aims to build the model
sequentially, supported by experimental diagnostics covering a wide range of parameters. The model is
expected to answer the question of whether or not there will be a breakdown for a given complex
geometry of electrodes and insulation systems under a given voltage waveform. The work has the
potential to address industrial applications and is of great importance to higher voltage systems.

Theory of the Femtosecond and Attosecond Dynamics of Molecules
in Complex Regions of their Potential Landscapes
Dr. Loren Greenman, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Kansas State University
Manhattan, KS 66506
The capture and transfer of energy by complex molecular structures, developed over millennia by
evolution or engineered meticulously by scientists, is a remarkable phenomenon. At some scale of
complexity, molecules gain the ability to control this process and direct the energy to accomplish useful
tasks. This project seeks an answer to the question of where this scale begins, and specifically whether
very energetic excitations in relatively simple molecules can be controlled. Lasers are our best tool to
controllably add energy into molecules, and this project investigates the excitations and the subsequent
dynamics produced by recently developed laser pulses with durations on the femtosecond (10-15 seconds)
and attosecond (10-18 seconds) timescales. These pulses approach the natural timescale of the motion of
electrons in molecules and can excite localized motion of electrons or atoms in molecules. The question
of whether chemical reactions can be controlled with lasers has been explored in detail, especially for the
ground state and the first few electronic excited states of molecules. While these initial questions were
met with some successes and many struggles, recent progress in the field has seen the laser-induced
formation of chemical bonds and the control of fragmentation in strong fields. These successes, and the
ability to use attosecond pulses to prepare molecules in excited states higher in the energy spectrum,
renew the promise of exerting specific control over molecules and their transformations. High-lying
excited states in molecules, which are relatively unexplored, have different coupling regimes, transition
timescales, and state densities compared to the ground state and first few excited states. The unique
properties of high-lying excited states provide new targets that can be used to control the flow of energy
in excited molecules. Importantly, the theoretical tools to describe the energetic excitations and their
control are also at the forefront of method development. This project takes advantage of recent advances
in the areas of quantum optimal control theory, electronic structure including ionizing states, and nuclear
dynamics in order to describe excitations with attosecond pulses and develop the control schemes that
can exploit them. The methods developed in this project push forward the abilities to compute dynamics
in these systems and to provide unprecedented control of molecules.

Organic electronics based on semiconducting polymers are important for a broad range of next-
generation renewable energy applications. Precise control of polymer conformation is critical for the
device performance. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate thin film morphologies for
specific electronic and optical properties required for end-use products. The goal of this research is to

with computational infrastructure to probe the structure and dynamics of polymers both in solution and
thin films. High-throughput instrumentation, combined with machine-learning, will accelerate the
understanding of the relationship between processing and device morphology. Ultimately, the project will
1) develop new high-performance semiconducting polymers with controllable morphologies; 2) advance
neutron scattering for characterizing thin-film devices; and 3) elucidate the effect of various solution
processing conditions on device performance for technologies such as photovoltaics, highly efficient light-

Harnessing the Large Hadron Collider with New Insights in
Real-Time Data Processing and Artificial Intelligence
Dr. Philip Harris, Assistant Professor

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
The next two decades of scientific research at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European
Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland are anticipated to be remarkably different than the last
two decades. With large amounts of data expected, the focus of research transforms from probing novel
particle interactions of LHC collisions at the highest energies towards unexplored precision measurements
and searches that target physics processes with small interaction strengths and extensive background
rates. As a result, additional rare and hidden processes within the Standard Model (SM) of particle
physics, and potentially beyond the SM, are expected to emerge as the LHC’s luminosity continues to
increase. This research focuses on a robust physics program at the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)
experiment to measure these smaller and inconspicuous processes by applying a new measurement
technique that can identify light resonances that decay into quarks. This new technique, in conjunction
with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) computational algorithms, can not only lead to further constraints
on the production of dark matter but can also open up a wealth of unique measurements and searches,
including precision measurements of fundamental properties of the Higgs boson and an extended
exploration for dark matter. In addition to the proposed studies, the research will upgrade the current
real-time data acquisition system for the CMS detector to provide enhanced capabilities that will enable
AI-based real-time analyses of LHC collisions. The fully developed state-of-the-art system will empower
new measurements of the Higgs boson, new searches for dark matter, and the analyses of a multitude of
unexplored scientific phenomenon. Furthermore, a real-time AI system operating with the significant LHC
data rates represents a unique blueprint for future low-latency applications within science.

Cryogenic Electron Microscopy and Spectroscopy for Topological Spin Textures
in Two-Dimensional van der Waals Magnetic Materials
Dr. Kai He, Assistant Professor
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
Clemson University
Clemson, SC 29634
Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials are one of the most promising quantum
materials that could revolutionize information- and energy-related technologies because of two factors:
(1) the exotic properties enabled by the quantum confinement and (2) the feasibility of integrating these
properties into existing silicon technology to functionalize future devices. The unique atomically thin 2D
vdW structures provide an ideal platform for competition between the spin, charge, orbital, and lattice
degrees of freedom, giving rise to novel intrinsic magnetism and frustrated magnetism at the 2D atomic
limit. The goal of this research project is to identify, understand, and manipulate the topological spin
textures in 2D vdW magnetic materials and elucidate the underlying spin-orbit, spin-lattice, and spin-
charge interactions using cryogenic electron microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy approaches. More
specifically, the research will determine the topological charge and spin configuration of the topologically
protected quasiparticles and clarify the underlying spin-lattice and spin-phonon coupling mechanisms.
The findings will facilitate the desirable manipulation of topological spin excitation and spin transport
dynamics via the control of external magnetic and electrical probes, providing practical implications and
design principles for future spintronics and quantum information technologies. The development of
cryogenic electron microscopy capabilities will also advance the nanoscale characterization of magnetic
and electronic properties for a broad range of strongly correlated systems.

Domain-Decomposition Induced Parallelism for Scientific Deep Learning at Extreme Scale
Dr. Russell J. Hewett, Assistant Professor
Department of Mathematics
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg, VA 24061
A scale gap exists in scientific machine learning, or the intersection of computational science and
artificial intelligence. Current tractable computational science problems are orders of magnitude larger
than those in machine learning. In this project we will bridge that gap by developing parallel computing
frameworks that connect deep learning problems and algorithms to classical computational science
problems, at extreme scale. We target both data-driven scientific machine learning problems, posed
through deep neural networks, and physics-driven problems, posed jointly through neural networks and
physical models, to advance capabilities in DOE science applications. Our approach focuses on exploiting
domain decomposition to extract additional parallelism in deep neural network training and to enhance
interaction with high-performance computational tools for physics simulations. One theme of this
research focuses on accelerating neural networks with new distributed algorithms induced by domain
decomposition. Another theme centers on identifying and exploiting optimal domain decompositions for
highly heterogeneous neural networks. The final research theme aims to demonstrate the enhanced
parallel efficiency and scalability on applied problems related to, for example, subsurface imaging and
additive manufacturing on state-of-the-art supercomputers. Technology developed in this project will
integrate with and enhance the DOE's extensive high-performance computing ecosystem.

Controlling Photochemical Reactions with Optical Cavities
Dr. Edward G. Hohenstein, Senior Staff Scientist

Menlo Park, CA 94025
Photochemistry promises access to otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways and products
through the absorption of light. The challenge to meeting this promise is controlling these photochemical
reactions with enough specificity to be of practical value. Placing molecules in optical cavities enables
strong interactions of molecules with light and has the potential to drive photochemical reactions in novel
and unexpected directions. To fully realize the potential of optical cavities in the context of
photochemistry, theoretical tools must be developed to simulate these processes. This is particularly
challenging because the unusually strong light-molecule interactions in the cavity require the nuclei and
electrons of the molecule and the photons composing the light to be treated simultaneously. While
quantum electrodynamical (QED) methods capable of describing light-molecule interactions exist in the
chemistry and physics communities, they have rarely been combined with techniques to simulate
photochemical reaction dynamics. This research will develop a suite of simulation methods that combine
state-of-the-art approaches for describing the quantum states of molecules with QED treatments of light
in optical cavities. This research will explore the possibilities for controlling the yields and specificity of
photochemical reactions by manipulating the light-molecule interactions occurring within the cavity.

Interacting Topological Electronic States in Group-V Network Materials
Dr. Jin Hu, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
University of Arkansas
Fayetteville, AR 72701
The theory of topological phases and phase transitions, which is the seminal work of the 2016
Nobel Prize in Physics, has bridged particles in high energy physics and electrons in crystalline solids. Dirac,
Weyl, and Majorana fermions predicted in the Standard Model have found their counterparts in solid-
state topological materials. These emerging quantum materials have been leading to deeper knowledge
of important topics in physics and display a kaleidoscope of novel electronic properties with great promise
for technology applications. Thus far, the research in this young field has mainly focused on a non-
interacting single particle scenario. On the other hand, the electron-electron correlations are ubiquitous
in many processes and known to drive fascinating phenomena. Therefore, extending the topological
physics to the regime of interacting electronic system is expected to produce new quantum states and
exotic phenomena. With this vision, the overarching goal of this project is to study how electronic
correlations entangle with topology to give rise to new states and properties. The approach will be based
on Group-V network material platforms to establish interacting topological electronic states, study the
technological useful colossal magnetoresistance and its connection with topology and electronic
correlations, and design novel material systems that can be further functionalized. This research will
advance our understanding of the interacting topological quantum materials, seed new areas for deeper
inquiry, and generate critical momentum for the deployment of quantum materials in information
storage, sensing, and quantum computing applications.

Understanding Local Coevolution at Semiconductor Photocatalysts
Involving Coating Protection and Corrosion Mitigation
Dr. Shu Hu, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering
Yale University
New Haven, CT 06510
A promising approach for generating solar fuels uses particulate photocatalysts, in which reductive
and oxidative products are coevolved in close proximity. Previous photocatalysts use oxides or nitrides.
Despite decades of study, often with trial and erorr improvements to rates and selectivity, the solar-to-fuel
conversion efficiencies remain much lower than the theoretical limit. This project will develop oxide
coatings to protect semiconductors, such as silicon and gallium indium phosphide, to achieve efficient and
durable photocatalysis. The surface of coated photocatalysts will be functionalized with nanoparticle or
molecular co-catalysts. Understanding the coevolution locally at reductive and oxidative sites will advance
the photocatalyst design beyond trial and error. Since the coating may develop pinhole defects over time,
such understanding also helps mitigate photo-corrosion and improve durability. The objectives of this
research include: (1) elucidating the roles of nanoparticle co-catalysts, molecular co-catalysts, and
corrosion pinholes for charge separation; (2) characterizing the multi-scale coupled processes at the liquid
interface; and (3) tuning the local energetics and kinetics by adjusting the co-catalyst local environment.
The studies will take advantage of a recently developed kinetic model for photocatalysis by combining local
measurements with numerical simulations to quantify important processes at the photocatalyst/liquid
interface. Thus, photocatalysts with coating protection and corrosion mitigation can be designed to utilize
the various co-catalysts for producing fuels or chemicals by harvesting solar energy.

Parameterizing wet removal of aerosol-forming oxygenated gases and its regional and global impacts
Dr. Gabriel Isaacman-VanWertz, Assistant Professor
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg, VA 24061
Particles suspended in the atmosphere (“aerosols”) are responsible for a large fraction of global
deaths and have a substantial impact on the Earth’s energy balance, but their impacts remain uncertain
and difficult to model. Much of this particle mass is formed when gases emitted by natural and man-
made sources undergo sunlight-driven chemistry that produces soluble and condensable compounds,
forming particles. While these “aerosol-forming gases” are being chemically transformed, they are also
being removed from the atmosphere by precipitation and settling to the Earth’s surface, which can have
a significant effect on the formation, growth, and removal of aerosols. Unfortunately, the parameters
that control removal of gases from the atmosphere are highly uncertain, and almost no real-world
observations exist on the role of precipitation in this process. The goal of the proposed research is to use
existing and new data to quantify the rates at which atmospheric gases and particles are removed by
precipitation and to understand the role of precipitation in the formation of aerosols across several
sites. Characteristics of precipitation and atmospheric gases and particles will be used to estimate
removal of gases by precipitation at 12 globally distributed facilities in the DOE Atmospheric Radiation
Measurement (ARM) network. These existing data will be combined with unique measurements
collected in 2014 at the Manacapuru, Brazil ARM facility as part of the ARM GoAmazon campaign, and
new measurements of precipitation and removal of gases in Blacksburg, Virginia. The major outcome of
this research will be an improved understanding of the regional and global impacts of precipitation on
the formation of aerosol that is informed by real-world measurements and representative of diverse
geographical regions. Additional scientific advances expected from this research include new methods
to calculate the removal of gases from widely available measurements, increased availability of these
data, and advances in atmospheric chemistry models.

Node-to-Code Comparison-Centered Interactive Performance Visualization
Dr. Katherine Isaacs, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
The University of Arizona
Tucson, AZ 85721
Large computational endeavors such as climate models, energy simulations, and analytics libraries
require efficient use of vast and complex resources. Increasing the efficiency, or performance, of these
programs necessitates understanding the interactions between the program itself, the data it operates
on, the libraries it uses, and the hardware on which it runs. Poor performance can be due to previously
unseen scenarios that therefore cannot be checked automatically. Some of the information needed to
understand these scenarios may be known to developers but not available in machine-interpretable form.
Furthermore, often one needs a mental model of how the program and resources behave before they can
formulate performance optimization strategies.
Visualization encompasses a class of methods in exploratory data analysis that use the human
visual system to aid reasoning and understanding. It can be particularly helpful in situations where too
little is known to directly compute or estimate the desired answer. The performance analysis of
supercomputing applications is one such case. However, current performance visualizations are not
designed for the scale of the performance data that is presently collected nor the complexity of
performance factors such as the source code, input data, libraries, and hardware. These problems are
magnified when attempting to compare performance between multiple executions of the same program.
This project focuses on developing and evaluating scalable, interactive visual approaches that allow
performance analysts to connect factors in performance from the hardware nodes on which the programs
run to their source code and compare across multiple executions, thereby enabling them to understand
and ultimately improve the efficiency of their applications.

for basic science and technology. But, the radioactivity of these elements presents challenges. This
project aims to use one such element, radium, as the cornerstone for studying and controlling radioactive
molecules made with bottom-row elements with both high efficiency and high precision. Trapped radium
ions will be used to synthesize trapped radium-based molecules and study their properties with quantum
logic spectroscopy, a quantum information technique that was originally developed for optical atomic
clocks that has recently been applied to molecules. With radium-based molecules the project will also be
able to study properties of the radium nucleus and set the stage for using radioactive molecules to address
profound questions centered on time symmetry violation, such as why is the Universe filled with matter,
but lacks antimatter? A few rare radionuclides have massive octupole shape deformations, e.g. radium-
225 and protactinium-229, which makes them exceptionally sensitive to time symmetry violating or
equivalently charge parity violating physics. When these special nuclei are incorporated into a molecule,
they can gain a further thousand-fold sensitivity enhancement due to the molecule’s intense electric field.
The combined nuclear and molecular sensitivities may be exploited to search for a tiny time symmetry
violation signal using just a single trapped molecule.

Tracking the Mechanisms of Catalytic Reactions on Ligand-Protected Gold Nanoclusters
Dr. Christopher Johnson, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Stony Brook University
Stony Brook, NY 11794
Catalysts enable the production of an enormous array of chemicals on which modern society
relies, but reduction of the costs and environmental impacts of this production will necessitate the
development of new generations of catalysts that function efficiently in mild conditions. Furthermore,
understanding and quantifying the chemical mechanisms during catalytic reactions will be necessary to
optimize catalyst performance. This project focuses on an emerging class of catalysts, atomically precise
metal nanoclusters, which are small nanoparticles that can be produced with precisely known chemical
formulas and structures. These nanoclusters combine many of the advantages of nanoparticle catalysts,
particularly exposure of reactive metal surface sites, with those of molecular catalysts, namely tailorable
atomic geometries and the ability to produce the exact same catalysts in bulk quantities. Fully harnessing
these advantages could lead to catalysts that require less energy input, form fewer byproducts, or enable
new chemical transformations. Despite these advantages, progress on nanocluster catalysts has been
hampered by a lack of understanding, or even direct experimental probes, of the catalytic mechanisms
underlying their reactivity. This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying key elementary
reactions involved in electrocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions with nanocluster catalysts. Using
the unique capabilities of gas phase cluster chemistry techniques, the team will form and isolate elusive
catalytic nanocluster-reactant complexes and probe the extent to which they activate small molecules
such as CO and the structures of intermediates involved in the reaction. The extent of activation will be
2
tracked as the composition of the nanocluster is varied, elucidating the specific form of the cluster and
the cluster-molecule interactions driving reactivity. These insights will be used to guide new efforts to
precisely engineer more active sites on model catalytic nanoclusters. These studies will advance the
optimization and deployment of nanoclusters as effective catalysts by (1) yielding improved mechanistic
models that can be used to develop more active nanocluster catalysts for a variety of reactions, (2)
identifying potentially more active nanocluster compositions, and (3) providing clear examples of
successful approaches to engineering active sites.

Ion Transport in Highly Charged Polymer Membranes with Subnanometer Free Volume Elements
Dr. Jovan Kamcev, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemical Engineering, Macromolecular Science, and Engineering
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
Charged polymer membranes are key components of several ion separation technologies (e.g.,
electrodialysis and diffusion dialysis) and energy generation technologies (e.g., reverse electrodialysis and
fuel cells). Developing membranes with better selectivity and throughput would improve the efficiency of
existing technologies and enable the realization of emerging environmental and energy applications such
as redox flow batteries, microbial fuel cells, ion-exchange membrane bioreactors, and electrochemical
CO reduction. Rational design of new membranes with desired functionality and tailored selectivity
2
would be accelerated by improved fundamental understanding of the connection between polymer
structure and transport properties. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to establish
fundamental understanding of ion transport in highly charged polymer membranes with subnanometer
free volume elements (FVEs). The properties of this unique and largely unexplored class of membranes
are situated in a transition region between those of gas separation membranes, in which polymer
backbone dynamics influence small molecule transport, and highly swollen charged membranes, in which
tortuosity and Coulombic interactions are most important. The discovery of new ion transport
mechanisms in highly charged membranes with subnanometer FVEs and molecular-level understanding
of such phenomena could enable the design of membranes with properties that are specifically tailored
for a given application. To better understand the connection between polymer structure and transport
properties in this class of membranes, the proposed research combines membrane synthesis, advanced
morphological characterization, and characterization and modeling of membrane transport properties.

Drawing Electronic Structure on the Nanoscale using Switchable Molecular Interfaces
Sarah B. King, Neubauer Family Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
The University of Chicago
Chicago, IL 60637
Nanoscale morphological variations are an omnipresent problem in materials for advanced
energy technologies. Depending on the degree of variation, and how it effects the electronic structure
and properties of a material, the impact can range from a decrease in the efficiency of an electronic device
to a complete misunderstanding of a catalytic mechanism and poor catalytic selectivity. Atomically thin,
two-dimensional materials are particularly sensitive to this inhomogeneity problem due to the realities of
their synthesis and preparation, yet also uniquely suited to tuning and healing at the nanoscale level due
to their responsiveness to the external environment. The goals of this research program are to understand
how particular structural motifs modify the electronic structure of 2D materials and to design an easy way
to heal or modify these motifs for specific functionalities, such as charge transport or ferroelectricity.
Time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy will be used to uncover how nanostructures and their
modifications determine the electronic structure and functionality of two model 2D materials, black
phosphorus and indium selenide. The project will interface black phosphorus with a photoswitchable
molecule and determine the mechanism by which isomerization of the photoswitchable molecule changes
the electronic structure and dynamics of the interfacial black phosphorus material layer. The research will
demonstrate the generalizability of the interfacial modification mechanism for encoding functionality in
indium selenide. Using light to apply specific patterns on the photoswitchable molecular interfaces, the
project will then draw new electronic structure on the nanoscale and encode charge transport or
ferroelectricity in both 2D materials. Beyond the discernible goal of elucidating how specific structure
variations dictate material processes, the research will generate an electronic structure-informed
platform to explore how molecular interfaces sensitive to light, heat, or force can be used to redraw the
electronic structure landscape and achieve tailorable materials for solar cells, catalysis, quantum
information, microelectronics, or energy storage.

Adaptive and Fault-Tolerant Algorithms for Data-Driven Optimization, Design, and Learning
Dr. Drew P. Kouri, Principal Member of Technical Staff
Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification
Sandia National Laboratories
Albuquerque, NM 87185
Many paramount applications for the U.S. Department of Energy are formulated as nonsmooth
variational problems. For instance, variational inequalities describe critical subcomponents of climate
models including ice sheets and sea ice, as well as the interaction between fuel pellets and their
protective cladding in light-water nuclear reactors. In addition, training machine learning models,
parameter estimation in seismology, energy network resource allocation, and radio frequency cavity
design for particle accelerators are all formulated as optimization problems. To efficiently and reliably
solve these problems on advanced computational architectures, we will develop algorithms for
stochastic optimization-based simulation that exploit adaptive, inexact, and randomized computations
to accelerate convergence. Existing methods for nonsmooth variational problems suffer from numerous
deficiencies, including slow convergence rates near solutions and performance degradation as the
problem size increases. To ensure scalability to extreme scales, we will develop efficient algorithms for
nonsmooth problems that rigorously manage inexact computations and refine approximation quality as
the algorithm converges—permitting inexpensive approximations during early iterations. We will
augment these algorithms with novel online modeling approaches based on randomized linear algebra
and adversarial learning to discover underlying problem structures. Our algorithms will not only
transform optimization-based simulation by exploiting the extreme heterogeneity of modern computing
environments with adaptive and asynchronous computations but will also safeguard against hardware
faults and failures through tunable randomized compression.

Ultrafast Coherent X-ray Scattering Studies of Quantum Materials
Dr. Roopali Kukreja, Assistant Professor
Materials Science and Engineering
University of California Davis
Davis, CA 95616
Quantum materials have emerged as potential candidates to realize energy-efficient computing
for ever-increasing technological demands of the internet of things, big data, and cloud computing.
Quantum materials display strong correlations between their spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of
freedom, which results in a rich variety of electronic and magnetic properties. Emergence of novel
quantum states under non-equilibrium conditions in quantum materials challenges the limits of
understanding at microscopic length scales and ultrafast time scales. However, fundamental
understanding of the role of nanoscale disorder and fluctuations in quantum materials is impeded by the
lack of experimental methods which can access both characteristic lengthscales and timescales. This
project focuses on utilizing time-resolved coherent x-ray scattering studies to understand the role of
electronic and magnetic fluctuations in quantum materials and their dynamical behavior under laser
excitation. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at synchrotron sources and upcoming x-ray free
electron sources (XFEL) will be utilized to access both nanoscale lengthscales and fundamental timescales
to study thermal fluctuations of electronic and magnetic order across phase transitions. Sample ground
states will be carefully tuned via structural parameters including epitaxial strain, anion stoichiometry, and
cation doping to investigate their role on evolution of electronic and magnetic ordering. These studies will
enable mapping of the domain dynamics and correlations as a function of emergent electronic and
magnetic ordering. The proposed project will utilize recently developed and upcoming user facilities such
as National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II), Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), and LCLS II as well as
existing facilities such as Advanced Photon Source (APS) and Advanced Light Source (ALS). These studies
will lead to development of a complete overview of electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of
quantum materials with time scales down to the ultrafast regime and atomic resolution, to unravel
nanoscale disorder in quantum materials and its evolution upon optical excitation.

Characterizing Plant-Specific Features of Mitochondrial Respiratory Complexes
Dr. James Letts, Assistant Professor
Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology
University of California, Davis
Davis, CA 95616
Despite the centrality of respiration to plant biomass accumulation, carbon flux, and acclimation,
the fundamental mechanisms plant mitochondrial complexes use to produce electrochemical proton
gradients that are converted into chemical energy remain unknown. A detailed functional and structural
understanding of plant respiratory mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complexes is essential
to understand the fundamental mechanisms of biological energy conversion. By applying expertise in
mitochondrial-membrane-protein biochemistry and structure biology, the PI recently obtained cryoEM
structures of the protein complexes CI*, CIII , CIV and SC III +IV from Vigna radiata (mung bean)—the first
2 2
high-resolution structures for mitochondrial complexes and supercomplexes for any plant. The project
will characterize the plant-specific features of these and other plant mitochondrial respiratory complexes
and supercomplexes functionally and structurally, using biochemical and biophysical approaches including
chromatographic purifications, single particle cryoEM and, enzyme-kinetic analyses.
A deep structural/functional understanding of the components of plant mETC will provide insights
into bioenergy conversion. This research will test hypotheses generated by the PI’s recent structures to
answer longstanding mechanistic questions such as the catalytic function of CI’s carbonic anhydrase
domain and the interplay between CIII ’s dual roles. The research will also test novel hypotheses triggered
2
by the structures, such as the potential functional role of CI*. These studies may produce additional
breakthrough structures that will enable new detailed hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of these
plant complexes and supercomplexes. The project will shed light on the fundamental tenets of electron
transport in plant mitochondria and will generate approaches, materials, and hypotheses for the
continued mechanistic examination of energy-converting enzymes in plants, advancing the field of plant
respiration and bioenergetics. The research can also further the understanding of other areas of plant
biology such as photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, and stress response.

When Covalent Organic Frameworks Meet Cross-coupling Reactions:
Directed Synthesis, Mechanistic Investigation, and Energy Application
Dr. Xinle Li, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Clark Atlanta University
Atlanta, GA 30314
Assembling molecular subunits into well-ordered architectures enables the precision synthesis of
materials and furnishes novel properties. It had been a formidable task to construct artificial crystalline
organic polymers until the discovery of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in 2005. COFs represent an
emerging class of crystalline porous materials that permit the integration of organic units into periodic
networks. COFs feature intriguing properties such as high crystallinity, permanent porosity, lightweight
character, versatile synthesis, and adjustable structures, which underpin their use in energy relevant
applications such as catalysis, supercapacitors, photovoltaics, rechargeable batteries, and radionuclide
sequestration. The formation of COFs usually hinges on reversible reactions which impart defect-healing
to yield the most thermodynamically stable crystalline materials. Notwithstanding, the reliance upon
reversible reactions limits the chemical stability and structural complexity of COFs. Therefore, moving bulk
COF synthesis beyond the common reliance on reversible reactions will create novel COFs with
exceptional chemical robustness and optoelectronic properties inaccessible by conventional means. The
current synthesis of COFs beyond reversible reactions is mainly limited to the growth of 2D COFs at
confined interfaces, whereas the facile synthesis of bulk COFs via single-step irreversible reactions
remains largely underexplored. Among numerous irreversible reactions, transition-metal-mediated cross-
coupling reactions are recognized as the most versatile synthetic toolkits to access robust covalent bonds.
The enormous functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and superb
efficiency underpin their broad use in the synthesis of porous materials. However, the emergent materials
are mostly amorphous. The objective of this research is to translate irreversible cross-coupling reactions
into the realm of COFs through a feedback loop of directed synthesis, mechanistic investigation, and
energy application. Thereby, freeing bulk COF synthesis from the ‘tyranny’ of reversible reactions.
Specifically, self-directional monomers will be linked through cross-coupling reactions to afford as-yet-
undiscovered robust COFs. To accelerate the COF formation, microwave-assisted synthesis will be applied.
Further, pre-formed COF analogs will act as topology templates for the controlled synthesis of new COFs
via cross-coupling reactions. These new COFs will be exploited in photocatalysis and explored in-depth to
reveal the origins of catalytic properties. In addition to the directed synthesis, the formation mechanism
of novel COFs will be unraveled by a combination of experimental and computational approaches
including ex-situ kinetic studies, in-situ probes, and computational simulations. This research directly fits
the Material Chemistry Program in Basic Energy Sciences (BES) since it will produce new COFs through
mechanistic understandings and precise control of synthetic pathways.

Machine Learning-Augmented Multimodal Neutron Scattering for Emergent Topological Materials
Dr. Mingda Li, Assistant Professor
Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, MA 02139
Topological materials are a class of quantum materials where the materials’ electronic or
functional properties are robustly protected against local perturbation. Such topological robustness
enables a wide range of promising applications, such as next-generation electronics immune from energy
dissipation, and fault-tolerant qubits for quantum computers. However, topology is seldom considered as
directly measurable, and scientists understand topological materials by measuring manifestations of
topology from complex experimental probes. Neutron scattering offers unique advantages in elucidating
topological quantum materials, such as high penetrating power, sensitivity to magnetism across multiple
spatial scales, and a direct link to elementary excitations. Yet there has been a lack of clear mapping
between topology and neutron spectra. The goal of this project is to capture the hallmark spectra
signatures of topology in neutron scattering spectra by using machine learning to analyze high-
dimensional spectra data. The project will a) capture the induced magnetic effect in topological insulators
for dissipationless spintronics applications, b) elucidate the formation criteria of topological magnetic
defects for computer memory and logic applications, and c) search for topological elementary excitations
with potential thermal management applications. The project will offer new insights by revealing the
hidden topological manifestations, in addition to enabling more efficient and reliable neutron scattering
data analysis.

Quantum materials present a range of remarkable properties with enormous potential for future
energy-relevant technologies. Fundamental research to comprehensively understand the interplay of
collective modes with quasiparticle dynamics and the discovery/characterization of new electronic phases
at the relevant length, time, and energy scales is critical for explaining their macroscopic physical-chemical

research is to develop a neutron probe with unprecedented resolution, which will be used to obtain
deeper insights into the basic organizing principles and their responses to external perturbations that are
at play in quantum materials. The new scattering methods developed with this research will also form a
basis for next generation neutron scattering instrumentation, which can be potentially utilized to unveil
novel properties of quantum materials, such as entanglement and chirality. The success of this research

Detecting Particle Dark Matter
Dr. Tongyan Lin, Assistant Professor of Physics
Department of Physics
University of California, San Diego
La Jolla, CA 92093
It is well established that dark matter pervades our universe, based on its gravitational pull, but
the constituents of this substance remains a leading scientific puzzle. This research will develop theories
and strategies to detect particle dark matter and uncover its properties. One aim of this research is to
develop new theoretical tools needed to predict dark matter signatures in low-threshold direct detection
experiments. Direct detection experiments aim to observe non-gravitational interactions of dark matter,
but a large class of dark matter candidates could have easily evaded detection in existing experiments.
Lower energy experiments would be sensitive to such candidates but are theoretically more challenging
because they involve understanding detailed material properties. The research will lead to precise
predictions and novel directions for direct detection in these new kinematic regimes. A second goal is to
investigate the imprints of particle dark matter within our cosmos and in astrophysical data. Dark matter
that has non-gravitational interactions during the early years of our universe can leave characteristic
patterns in the cosmic microwave background or clustering of matter. This research will explore the
cosmic history of dark matter candidates and apply observational data to search for possible particle
interactions. Overall, the outcome of this research will be to broaden our searchlight to cover a wider
range of well-motivated theories and could lead to new observational clues pointing us towards the
particle physics of dark matter.

Improving Coherence Times for Quantum Devices Beyond the Next Decade
Dr. Ben Loer, Physicist
Signature Science and Technology Division
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99354
Emerging quantum information technologies have the potential to revolutionize many areas in
science and computing. It has recently been demonstrated that ionizing radiation contributes to errors in
superconducting qubits. If these devices continue their current rate of improvement, ordinary levels of
background radiation could become the dominant source of errors within the next decade. The goal of
this project is to develop methods to reduce radiation impacts on superconducting quantum devices. The
project has three thrusts. First, the response of qubits to a variety of tailored radiation sources will be
measured to better understand and model how radiation interacts in these devices at the microscopic
level. With this knowledge, new devices may be developed with intrinsically reduced sensitivity to
radiation. Second, new types of cryogenic radiation sensors will be developed to better measure the
qubit’s environment in real time, including a first-of-its-kind hybrid device combining superconducting
qubits and microcalorimeter radiation sensors on a single chip. Finally, developing new methods in
quantum computing to integrate classical sensor data and detect radiation-induced conditions will enable
more accurate quantum calculations with the application of sensor-assisted quantum fault mitigation
(Sensor-QFM) concepts. The results of this project will provide a crucial stepping-stone on the path to
realizing the full potential of superconducting quantum technologies.

Innovative High-Frequency Structures for High-Gradient Wakefield Acceleration
Dr. Xueying Lu, Assistant Professor

Northern Illinois University
De Kalb, IL 60115
High energy particle accelerators are crucial to the next big discovery in particle physics. To reduce
the size and cost of particle accelerators, increasing the accelerating gradient (energy gain per unit length
for the particle beam) is a research topic of critical importance. Advanced accelerator concepts hold the
promise of revolutionary future particle colliders with dramatically higher gradients than what
conventional accelerator technologies allow. Structure wakefield acceleration (SWFA) is a very promising,
emerging advanced accelerator concept, where the high-gradient accelerating field is excited by an
electron beam passing through an optimized structure in vacuum. This research will pursue two key
concepts for high-gradient structures for SWFA: (1) developing advanced structures with novel, greatly
improved electromagnetic properties, such as metamaterial structures; (2) pushing up the operating
frequency of SWFA into the sub-terahertz and terahertz range. The research will pave the way for a future
collider based on these innovative SWFA concepts, and could also lead to new applications in high power
microwave sources and in compact light sources for scientific and industrial applications. This research
will capitalize on the unique beam lines equipped with the world’s highest charge cathode at the Argonne
Wakefield Accelerator at the Argonne National Laboratory.

Nanomaterials for use in Radionuclide Generator Systems for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides
Dr. Tara Mastren, Assistant Professor
Nuclear Engineering Program
University of Utah
Salt Lake City, UT 84112
Radionuclide generators are devices used to provide short-lived radionuclides to researchers that
are not located near a production facility. They work by using a long-lived parent radionuclide that decays
to the short-lived radionuclide of interest, allowing for repeated separations of the daughter over the half-
life of the parent. The most famous example of such a system is the 99Mo/99mTc system where 99Mo is
strongly bound to a resin-based column and 99mTc is routinely eluted for nuclear medicine applications.
Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has grown significantly in recent years as a methodology of interest for
cancer therapy. TAT utilizes alpha decay, a prominent decay mode of actinide elements, to induce cell
death in cancer cells. Several alpha emitting radionuclides have short half-lives, requiring the use of a
radionuclide generator system for use in research and clinical applications. Two such radionuclides are
213Bi (45.6 m) and 226Th (30.6 m), which are available via decay of their parent radionuclides 225Ac (9.92 d)
and 230Pa/230U (17.4 d/20.8 d), respectively. A major drawback in the development of radionuclide
generator systems for alpha emitters is the deposition of their energy (4-9 MeV) in short µm path lengths.
The same benefit we get from alpha decay for cancer treatment destroys traditional resin systems at
activities required for clinical use (>100 mCi). As traditional radionuclide generator systems are ineffective
for alpha emitting radionuclides, we must rethink how we develop these generators. Metals are more
radioresistant than the organic materials used in resins and thus could be beneficial for use in alpha
emitting radionuclide generator systems. Moreover, if we take advantage of the physical process of alpha
decay for separation it could be possible to overcome some of the chemical limitations. During alpha
decay the daughter radionuclide has significant recoil energy (~100 keV), which is high enough to break
chemical bonds (eV) and travel significant nanometer distances in various materials. Nanomaterials have
been used in a variety of applications including environmental, medical, and chemical. These materials
have the potential to be a promising solution in the development of radionuclide generator systems for
alpha emitting radionuclides, however to date have not been investigated for this purpose. Furthermore,
harsh chemicals would not be required for the separation as it would rely on the physical processes in
alpha decay. This would facilitate the delivery of short-lived radionuclides in a form that is amenable to
immediate use in radiolabeling reactions minimizing synthesis time and therefore increasing
radiochemical yield.

First Principles Measurements of Temperature and Transport Properties
in Warm Dense Matter
Dr. Emma Elizabeth McBride, Panofsky Fellow/Associate Scientist
Fundamental Physics
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, CA 94025
The realization of inertial fusion energy requires the development of novel diagnostics that allow
model-independent first principles measurements of ion temperature and transport properties of high-
density, high-temperature plasmas. Also important to understand is the behavior of matter as it passes
through the warm dense matter regime on the way to these dense fusion plasma states. Warm dense
matter (WDM), an intriguing state characterized by having near solid electron densities (i.e., > 1021 cm-3)
and extreme pressures and temperatures (P > 1 Mbar, T > 1 eV; 11,605 K), lies in a region of phase space
not well described by condensed matter or plasma physics, making experimental characterization
essential. While this state of matter is ubiquitous throughout the universe, found in the cores of giant
planets and stars, and in inertial fusion energy processes, it remains challenging to create and
simultaneously diagnose experimentally. Such extreme states of matter are created in the laboratory by
a variety of methods including shock compression using nanosecond lasers, or by isochoric heating via
femtosecond lasers. The created states are therefore highly-transient, existing from a few picoseconds to
a few nanoseconds, and have a large density of free electrons, making them challenging to probe using
optical techniques. The advent of Free Electron Laser light sources such as the LCLS, SLAC, has
revolutionized how WDM experiments are performed. The LCLS provides extremely bright X-rays,
femtoseconds in duration, capable of penetrating and probing the highly-ionized and transient WDM
state. While measurements of the structure of WDM using X-ray diffraction have become almost routine
using these methods, the direct measurement of temperature, an essential thermodynamic parameter
for understanding the phase diagram or equation of state, remains outstanding. This research project will
develop high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering techniques in the collective and non-collective scattering
regimes at hard X-ray Free Electron Lasers to directly obtain first principles measurements of both
temperature and transport properties i.e., viscosity and sound speed, from matter at extreme conditions.
The techniques that will arise from this research proposal will provide unprecedented insight into WDM
and inertial fusion energy process and will have significant impact on many additional and varied fields of
physics including geophysics, astrophysics, shock and plasma physics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
and the search for novel materials.

Building from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Multidimensional Catalyst Architectures:
The Effects of Charge Delocalization and Electronic Coupling on Electrocatalytic Activity
Dr. Charles C. L. McCrory, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is an important strategy for storing renewable
energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind in the form of chemical bonds. Molecular inorganic
complexes show significant promise as electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to
useful chemical feedstocks and solar fuels. An outstanding challenge is incorporating these molecular
catalysts into heterogeneous, multidimensional structures that reduce carbon dioxide with high activity
and stability, but also maintain the selectivity of discrete, molecular catalysts. The objective of this
research is to determine how the complicated and interrelated effects of charge delocalization,
intramolecular electrostatics, and electronic coupling influence catalytic activity and selectivity in
extended multidimensional catalyst architectures. The specific research approach uses a combination of
electroanalytical and spectroelectrochemical measurements to probe the relative influence of these
effects on catalytic performance as the catalyst structures increase in complexity from discrete molecular
catalysts, to multimetallic molecular assemblies, and finally to extended 1D and 2D catalyst structures.
The results of this research will provide a template for the rational design of new multidimensional
catalyst materials, comprised of molecular catalyst building units, for the efficient and selective
electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added products.

Epitaxial Stabilization of Novel Superconductors for Energy Generation, Storage and Distribution
Dr. Julia A. Mundy, Assistant Professor

Harvard University
Cambridge, MA 02139
Superconducting materials hold great promise for applications in energy generation, storage, and
distribution. However, known superconductors still lack the transition temperatures, critical fields, or
pairing symmetry to be fully exploited for these applications. This has not only continued to motivate the
optimization of known superconducting materials, but further driven efforts for the discovery of new
families of superconductors. This Early Career program will exploit the characteristics of the copper oxide-
based superconductors as design criteria in the search for additional new materials that could host high-
temperature superconductivity. The plan is to design, synthesize, and probe with atomic-scale precision
metastable nickelate and cobaltate thin films. This work will tackle two intertwined synthesis challenges:
1) how does one control the local oxygen coordination and environment in a complex oxide material
during synthesis and 2) how does one monitor and manipulate changes to the oxygen coordination post-
synthesis. In both thrusts, new synthetic techniques are proposed that will allow reaching previously
unexplored compounds. While the main work will focus on developing specific techniques for the
stabilization and exploration of hypothesized superconductors, it is notable that the ability to create novel
oxygen coordination environments should have broader impacts for a variety of non-perovskite oxide
materials.

What is the Matter Within Polaritons: Molecular Control of Collective Hybrid States
Andrew J. Musser, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology
Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14850
When carbon-based organic semiconductors emit or absorb light, a discreet event occurs in which
energy is exchanged between particles of light (a photon) and electrical current (an electron). Instead of
such discreet jumps, it is possible to make devices in which the photons and electrons mix together,
forming entirely new hybrid states called polaritons. This can be done by placing certain molecular
materials between two very closely spaced mirrors in a microcavity. The mirrors act like miniature boxes
and trap photons, allowing them to interact and combine with electrons in the semiconductor. The
resulting states blend the character of the two parent particles, leading to entirely new behaviors ranging
from enhanced conductivity and energy transport to altered chemical reactivity. This approach holds the
promise to rewrite molecules’ energy landscape and tune their functional properties at will, without
recourse to laborious synthetic chemistry. Yet fundamental questions about this concept prevent its
application: What properties does the polariton inherit from the parent molecules? How can we influence
these behaviors with molecular structure? This research will tackle these questions and develop a detailed
understanding of how the complexity of organic semiconductors can be harnessed to control polariton
behavior. The effort calls for cutting-edge laser spectroscopies to record the ultrafast processes inside the
microcavity, systematically correlated with the properties of the parent organic semiconductor. This work
will lead to new, fundamental understanding of the nature of both molecular materials and light-matter
interactions, paving the way to a future where we can non-synthetically rewrite molecules’ properties.
Moreover, the principles uncovered will spur new approaches to exploit polaritons for more energy-
efficient light-emitting and light-harvesting systems and open new opportunities from photocatalysis and
sensing to room-temperature quantum devices.

Probing Quantum Materials with Evanescent Waves
Using Advanced 4-Dimensional Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy
Dr. Guangxin Ni, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Florida State University
Tallahassee, FL 32306
When light strikes a host material, the inherent light-matter interactions that take place encode
extremely valuable information about the material’s properties under study. Of particular interest are the
long-wavelength excitations at the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where critical low-energy
physics can be explored noninvasively in most quantum materials. Currently, the performance of existing
IR & THz microscopies is largely limited by their spatial resolution, which has severely hindered the ability
to understand a wide array of exotic quantum effects that typically emerge from the nanometer length
scales. This research will develop advanced scanning near-field optical microscopy capable of examining
quantum materials under extreme conditions at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields, while
extending imaging to nanometer length scales, femtosecond time scales, and the IR and THz spectral
range simultaneously. The result of this four-dimensional characterization will be a greater understanding
of two-dimensional quantum materials that possess intriguing quantum phases of matter and novel
properties, including superconductivity, metal to insulator transitions, and topological states. Harnessing
strong light-matter interactions represents a unique way to explore the uncharted territory of quantum
systems under extreme conditions, which is far beyond what is attainable with conventional optics and
could lead to the development of new types of quantum devices on-demand. The nano-optics
methodologies developed in this research will benefit the explorations of a broader class of quantum
materials for both fundamental science and potential technological applications.

Simulation-based Inference for Cosmological Parameter Estimation and Discovery
Dr. Brian Nord, Scientist
Scientific Computing Division
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
Batavia, IL 60510
The earliest and latest epochs of the Universe are marked by periods of cosmic acceleration —
an increasingly rapid expansion of space-time. While the exact cause remains a mystery, powerful clues
are encoded in large corpuses of imaging data obtained by telescopes that scan the sky during multi-
year observational surveys. The conventional computational tools used to decode cosmic clues rely
primarily on hand-parameterized analytic mathematical models and relatively static, inflexible
algorithms. However, next-generation surveys, like the Cosmic Microwave Background Stage 4 (CMB-S4)
project and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), both with
significant DOE roles, have unprecedented instrumental sensitivity and will produce data of
commensurate size and complexity. This necessitates new algorithms and modeling techniques that
have appropriately extraordinary speed and adaptability, allowing us to achieve sufficient levels of detail
in our descriptions of the data. Data-driven computational tools, like artificial intelligence (AI), have
these characteristics, but they critically lack interpretability. In this project, we will use frameworks like
simulation-based inference that combine AI with statistical methods to model cosmic probes, enable
new measurements of cosmic acceleration, and discover new physics in cosmological data.

Novel Data-Processing Strategies for New Physics Searches and
Precision Luminosity Measurements at the Large Hadron Collider
Dr. Simone Pagan Griso, Divisional Fellow
Physics Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been remarkably successful in explaining
observed phenomena at the forefront of fundamental physics, yet experimental observations and
theoretical considerations indicate that the model is still incomplete. Predictions from the SM continue
to be stringently tested by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s highest energy
particle accelerator, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. This
research plans to develop and deploy innovative data-processing and event reconstruction algorithms
that can greatly advance the physics discovery potential of the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)
experiment at the LHC. New algorithms using next-generation machine learning techniques to reconstruct
charged particles will be developed while also employing sophisticated data-processing methods, which
will enable researchers to apply such algorithms “on-demand” only to the most relevant subset of the
large dataset collected by the experiment. The tools in turn will identify physics processes involving two
photons that get emitted by the colliding LHC beams to produce massive particles with unprecedented
accuracy. Specifically, a measurement of the SM quartic coupling between photons and W bosons
together with direct searches for new physics phenomena in high-energy photon-photon collisions will be
performed. Complementing this program, design studies, prototype development, and performance
measurements of a new state-of-the art addition for the ATLAS silicon detector will be pursued in order
to advance precision measurements of, and extend the discovery potential for, several physics processes
during the future High-Luminosity LHC running period.

Accurate calibration of SNS neutrino flux with a heavy-water detector for COHERENT
Dr. Diana Parno, Assistant Professor of Physics
Department of Physics
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA 15213
Neutrinos are the lightest, most rarely interacting matter particles known to science. Through
precise measurements of a newly observed type of neutrino interaction – coherent elastic neutrino-
nucleus scattering (CEvNS) – the COHERENT collaboration, working at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), aims to illuminate exciting possibilities beyond the Standard Model,
while simultaneously benchmarking detection methods for both supernova neutrinos and hypothesized
dark-matter particles. The largest uncertainty in these measurements is the flux of neutrinos created
when 1-GeV protons strike the thick mercury target at the SNS. Based on physics simulations and
worldwide measurements of similar processes, this rate can only be estimated to about 10% accuracy.
This research program will support COHERENT’s physics goals by completing a heavy-water neutrino
detector that will make a dedicated, benchmark measurement of the electron-neutrino flux from the SNS,
based on well-understood neutrino interactions in deuterium. The research team will build the second
and final module of the planned heavy-water Cerenkov detector, allowing COHERENT to reach the
necessary statistical precision. The flux measurement will significantly improve the accuracy of the
neutrino-interaction results in every other COHERENT detector, and it will enable a better understanding
of other, similar sources around the world.

From Atomic Nuclei to Infinite Nucleonic Matter within Chiral Dynamics
Dr. Maria Piarulli, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Washington University in St. Louis
St. Louis, MO 63130
The quest to describe classes of phenomena that occur in the atomic nucleus lies at the heart of
nuclear physics. These quantum mechanical phenomena play a major role in the birth and evolution of
the universe, in astrophysical environments, in energy production through fission and fusion reactions,
and in industrial and medical applications via use of stable isotopes and radioisotopes. Understanding the
structure and dynamics of nuclei and strongly interacting matter is, therefore, the primary focus of many
nuclear experimental programs and theoretical efforts. The present research will aim to develop a clear
and coherent picture in which microscopic models accurately describe atomic nuclei while simultaneously
predicting properties of infinite matter, e.g., pure neutron matter, relevant to the structure and internal
composition of neutron stars. It will make use of state-of-the-art computational techniques and high-
performance computing to broaden the applicability of variational and Green’s function Monte Carlo
methods, currently limited to bound states with mass number A ≤ 12. The results will directly address
some of the fundamental questions at the frontier of nuclear science and will complement the US
Department of Energy’s major investments in supporting present and future nuclear physics experiments
at low-, medium-, and high-energy.

Development of an Integrated Multiscale Methodology for Simulating Electrocatalysis
at the Metal Oxide - Electrolyte Interface
Dr. Craig Plaisance, M.F. Gautreaux/Albemarle Foundation Assistant Professor
Cain Department of Chemical Engineering
Louisiana State University
Baton Rouge, LA 70803
Electrocatalysis uses an electric current combined with a catalytically active surface to carry out
chemical reactions that would otherwise not occur. Due to its ability to use electricity generated from
renewable sources, electrocatalysis will play a vital role in the transition to a society based on sustainable
energy. As examples, water electrolysis can be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, while
CO electrolysis can be used to convert carbon dioxide into valuable fuels and chemicals. Despite its utility,
2
large scale adoption of many electrocatalytic technologies is hindered by lack of suitable catalysts that
can efficiently carry out the reactions without wasting a significant fraction of the electrical energy. The
key difficulty in developing more efficient electrocatalysts is the poor understanding of how the reactions
occur at the atomic level. The overall goal of this project is to develop a multiscale method to simulate
kinetics of electrocatalytic processes on metal oxide surfaces in the presence of a full atomistic description
of the electrochemical interface. The project will also provide an open-source simulation code enabling
researchers to perform realistic atomic level simulations of electrocatalysis with high accuracy and low
cost. This, in turn, will equip computational researchers with a vital tool for understanding how to
overcome the current limitations in important electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen evolution and
CO reduction.

First Principles Approach to Exciton Transport in Energy Materials
Dr. Diana Y. Qiu, Assistant Professor
Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science
Yale University
New Haven, CT 06520
The absorption of light by matter follows a universal mechanism that drives crucial reactions in
both natural and engineered systems. Processes ranging from photosynthesis, to photocatalysis, to
energy harvesting in photovoltaic cells all begin in the same way: the absorption of light creates an
exciton—a correlated electron-hole pair that carries energy rather than charge. In photovoltaics, the
relaxation of an initial high energy exciton into a lower energy state and its separation into individual
charge carriers dictate how much current can be generated from the absorption of sunlight. In
photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, energy is transmitted by excitons with surprisingly long
coherence times. In optoelectronics, excitonic interconnects have the potential to integrate the fast
speeds of information carried by photons into modern semiconductor-based electronics. In quantum
information and sensing, excitons allow for the optical preparation and transduction of quantum states
with specific spin, polarization, energy, and momentum. Hence, a predictive understanding of exciton
energies and coupling to light, as well as dynamical properties related to their decoherence, relaxation,
transport, and diffusion, is essential for the engineering of materials’ properties across all these fields, and
more. This project aims to develop and apply a range of first-principles theories (i.e., theories built ab
initio from the governing principles of quantum physics without any empirical parameters) based on the
GW one-particle self-energy plus the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach for two-particle interactions
within many-body perturbation theory to understand exciton dynamics in materials of interest for
optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and energy transport. Targeted materials include layered transition
metal dichalcogenides, hybrid metal-organic halide perovskites, and topological materials. The developed
methods will allow for predictive simulations of exciton transport and dynamics in the ballistic, diffusive,
and intermediate regimes.

Elucidating the Molecular Origins of Enhanced Carbon Mineralization Kinetics
in Adsorbed Water Nanofilms
Dr. Mohammad Javad Abdolhosseini Qomi, Assistant Professor
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
University of California Irvine
Irvine, CA 92697
In the earth’s subsurface, abundant rocks rich in divalent metal silicates such as basalt formations
have the theoretical capacity to mineralize CO by an order of magnitude greater than the estimated
2
emissions from burning all fossil fuel resources on Earth. The accessible capacity of these rocks depends
in part on the composition of the injected fluid, which directly influences the mineralization products and
their rate of formation. In a fluid dominated by CO , carbonation will be mediated by nanometer-thick
2
water films coating mineral surfaces. Through advanced molecular simulations, theory, and experiment,
this project aims to uncover underlying molecular mechanisms of carbonation reactions in thin water
nanofilms. The work will provide an understanding of the factors governing the rates of carbonation
reactions in water-poor systems. This basic understanding can ultimately pave the path toward
envisioning carbon-neutral mining practices, designing advanced reactive fluids for the enhanced oil and
gas recovery from unconventional reservoirs, and developing water-efficient carbon-negative concretes
for the construction of sustainable energy infrastructures in arid climates.

Improving candidate gene discovery by combining multiple genetic mapping datasets
Dr. Rubén Rellán-Álvarez, Assistant Professor
Department of Molecular and Structural Biochemistry
North Carolina State University
Raleigh, NC 27607
Identifying the genes involved in the adaptation of plants to their local habitat and to
environmental stresses are essential goals of plant scientists across a range of research fields. Knowledge
of such genes helps plant breeders to introduce beneficial traits from wild relatives into high-yielding
modern crop varieties. Plant biologists can also use that information to understand the role of genetic
variation in plant development, evolution, and stress response. However, it is complicated to validate the
function of genes at the molecular and physiological levels and determine the importance of the different
variants of a gene responsible for a particular trait. Identifying gene function is further complicated when
several genes are responsible for a trait of interest. Reducing the number of candidate genes and making
an informed decision on which ones should be validated is particularly challenging. This project’s goal is
to understand the impact of phosphorus deficiency and cold stress on sorghum lipid metabolism and
develop mathematical approaches that will integrate results from different genome-wide association
studies and population genetics indexes of selection. With these approaches, metabolic profiling data
from a large number of sorghum lines under phosphorous and cold stress will be combined with analyses
of geolocated natural populations adapted to those stresses and measures of genetic differentiation.
Combining multiple independent datasets will enable the identification and ranking of candidate genes
and metabolic pathways involved in these stress responses. The methods developed as part of this project
will be applicable to other potential bioenergy crops and different environmental stresses.

Advancing accelerator beam modeling via high-dimensional phase space diagnostics at a high-
intensity injector test stand
Dr. Kiersten Ruisard, Shull Fellow
Research Accelerator Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37830
This research aims to improve performance of high-power accelerators and support order-of-
magnitude increase in beam power. High-power accelerators deliver beam to targets, producing
secondary beams for experiments in fundamental and applied science. In operation, unintentional loss
of particles along the beamline must be minimized. Loss control is an important facet of accelerator
operations because it limits performance, as radioactivation in the tunnels can prevent maintenance.
Visions for future high-power facilities require losses at or below current levels while increasing power
to target by an order-of-magnitude or more. The research will advance fundamental understanding and
predictive power to model beam halo in megawatt-class accelerators. A source of losses, halo is an
undesired feature of beams that consists of particles far outside the core beam distribution. A challenge
in beam halo control is the lack of reliable models, which have not been shown to agree with halo
observations. Limited information of the real system plays a role, particularly the 6D phase space
distribution of the bunched beams. This work leverages unique diagnostic capability at the Spallation
Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF) to advance predictive capabilities for beam and halo
distributions. This includes full and direct measurement of the 6D beam distribution as well as complete
halo imaging. The compact BTF replicates conditions in the SNS front-end and will be used to generate a
large dataset containing both input for simulation parameters and output for validation of the front-end
model. More accurate modeling will lead to better loss control and improved performance of existing
accelerators. Neutron scattering facilities as well as other applications of multi-megawatt beams,
including proton drivers for neutrino physics, will benefit from this research.

Advanced Numerics for Atomization and Multi-Physics Interface Dynamics
Dr. Robert Saye, Research Scientist

Berkeley, CA 94720
The atomization of liquid into small droplets plays a key role in a diverse range of environmentally-
sensitive and energy-intensive processes, including, e.g., automobile spray painting, bubble aeration
systems, medical nebulizer devices, and biofuel combustion. To explore the underlying mechanisms,
optimize device design, and reduce material waste, the numerical simulation of these processes is often
required in order to model droplet formation and their multi-physics driven behavior. However,
traditional techniques are challenged by the highly complex geometry at play and progress using these
lower-order approaches is stalling. In this work, we aim to significantly advance the state of the art in
atomization numerics and multi-physics interface dynamics. We will develop higher-order numerics which
enable, and then harness, sub-grid resolution of complex interfacial geometry, and apply these methods
across a spectrum of next-generation DOE-relevant applications. The immediate goals of this work form
a crucial stepping stone in the longer-term vision of coupling the two worlds of (i) high-fidelity multi-
physics interface dynamics and (ii) surrogate-based reduced order models in order to explore the vast
parameter landscape typical of applications in manufacturing and industry. In tandem with high
performance computing, the mathematical and algorithmic advances developed in this work will help to
address a variety of DOE mission-critical challenges in multi-scale and multi-physics dynamics.

Neutron Yield Scaling with Current in Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) Discharges
Dr. Andréa Schmidt, Plasma Engineering Group Leader
National Security Engineering Division
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94550
The objective of this work is to understand the most outstanding and unresolved question in the
nuclear fusion science underlying the dense plasma focus (DPF) z-pinch concept—why does the scaling of
neutron yield versus plasma current decline dramatically above currents of about 3 million amps? State-
of-the-art DPF machines developed by DoE are addressing mission deliverables; this complementary basic
research seeks to move beyond the state-of-the-art. This project combines world-class computer
simulations with experiments on a newly commissioned megajoule-class DPF platform, the MegaJOuLe
Neutron Imaging Radiography (MJOLNIR) experiment. The fundamental science program is heavily guided
by the simulation efforts, and the experiments utilize new diagnostics to make the critical measurements
hypothesized to be important in understanding the variance in performance and roll-off in yield that has
been observed to date. The ultimate goal is to identify the barriers that prevent strong neutron yield
scaling (current to the 4th power, or I4), as plasma current is increased up to the maximum capabilities of
the new platform, 4 million amps. Understanding and mitigating the physical mechanism(s) controlling
the observed yield roll-off at high current will have a strong impact in the scientific community and open
the door to a number of exciting basic and applied science applications. Neutrons can be used to “look
through” objects, analogous to x-rays, but they are more effective than x-rays at creating images of
materials containing hydrogen, such as fuel or water. A bright enough neutron source of this type could
enable high-speed (50 nanosecond, or 50 billionths of a second) neutron “photographs” for imaging
engine fuel flow or the human body. This source could also be used for national security applications, such
as identification of isotopes within a contaminated waste area. For basic science, an effective high-
brightness source would also enable a low-cost high-rep-rate high-energy-density physics (HEDP)
experimental platform, which could be used to study shock physics, opacity experiments, and warm dense
matter, among other HEDP phenomena. Prepared by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

Reducing Top Systematic Uncertainties in Cosmological Analyses with Type Ia Supernovae and
Contaminated Photometric Samples
Dr. Daniel Scolnic
Assistant Professor of Physics
Physics Department
Duke University
Durham, NC 27708
A critical mystery in physics and a key research pillar of the DOE High Energy Physics (HEP) Cosmic
Frontier program is to understand the nature of dark energy that causes the universe to accelerate in its
expansion. While cosmological observations constrain the amount of dark energy to make up roughly
70% of the universe, its nature remains unknown. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were used to discover the
accelerating universe and today provide some of the tightest constraints on its nature. The research
project will develop new advances in analysis techniques that can significantly reduce the top systematic
uncertainties in the cosmological analysis of the supernova sample measured by the Dark Energy Survey
(DES). Specifically, using the expertise of the research group, the project will use new techniques and the
largest data samples to constrain models of the unexplained `intrinsic' scatter of SNe Ia and the relation
between SNe Ia properties and host-galaxy properties. The particular challenge of this work is that
samples will have a small fraction of core-collapse contamination and host-galaxy mis-association that can
significantly bias constraints on SNe Ia physics. By tackling this challenge, this work will both increase the
statistical precision of the sample and reduce the largest systematic in current analyses. Furthermore,
the research group will apply advances from the DES analyses to the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) survey both in terms of survey strategy optimization and image pipeline
performance, thus enhancing the science return of both of these DOE and National Science Foundation
partnerships. This work will be done at both the image and catalog level to perform pixel-to-cosmology
analyses of simulations of the LSST SNe survey. This work will enable the analysis of the LSST-Year1 SNe
Ia sample, which will be 15x larger than the DES 5-Year sample.

notable discoveries of exotic phenomena in extreme astrophysical environments as well as in materials

Electrocatalytic Modification and Upcycling of Polyvinylchloride and Chloroparaffins
Dr. Christo S. Sevov, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
The Ohio State University
Columbus, OH 43210
This research program will develop new reaction technologies that enable selective modification
of chlorinated plastics to create materials with altered physical properties, improved lifetimes, and new
end-of-life applications. Post-synthetic functionalization of polymers is critically important for modifying
the physical properties of plastics that are prepared with limited control over the molecular structure.
Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is an example of such a polymer, which has narrow range of macromolecular
properties. Altering these properties such that PVC can be utilized in a wide range of applications requires
high loadings (up to 50%) of plasticizers, toxic stabilizers, and volatile impact modifiers. These
formulations limit PVC recyclability, safety, and long-term stability. As examples, PVCs containing different
plasticizers cannot be recycled together. Over time, the non-covalent additives leach from PVC. Leached
plasticizers present an environmental hazard and leave the resulting plastic brittle with an increased
susceptibility to forming microplastics. Finally, disposal of chlorinated polymers is energy intensive
because conventional approaches of polyolefin pyrolysis create corrosive and acutely-toxic products. The
program objective is to develop solutions to these challenges through the discovery and mechanistic
understanding of new reaction chemistries using electrocatalysis for C–Cl bond functionalization that can
be applied directly on polymer chains. Through this research, the performance of PVCs will for the first
time be controlled at the molecular level, rather than through formulations chemistries that rely on non-
covalent additives.

Quantitative Characterization of Emerging Quark-Gluon Plasma Properties with Dynamical
Fluctuations and Small Systems
Dr. Chun Shen, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
Wayne State University
Detroit, MI 48201
High energy collisions of atomic nuclei create extreme conditions to study the collective property
of nuclear matter. Experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the U.S. and the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe create a novel state of matter Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which exhibits
quarks' and gluons' degrees of freedom at a temperature exceeding 2 trillion degrees Kelvin. The QGP
behaves like a nearly perfect fluid from the many-body effects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This
hot and dense soup of elementary particles filled our universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang as
the primordial liquid. The emergence of QGP's strongly coupled nature is studied by varying collision
energy and system size at RHIC and the LHC. The current Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC further
probes the QCD matter's phase structure, searching for the existence and location of the first order (liquid-
vapor) phase boundary between ordinary nuclear matter and QGP terminating at a critical point. This
project aims at elucidating QGP properties by understanding the dynamical evolution of stochastic
fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions from large to small systems. This research will provide a
quantitative characterization of the QGP properties, how it ripples, flows, and its phase structure by
interweaving theoretical many-body nuclear physics, high-performance computing, and advanced
machine learning techniques. The QGP viscosity and charge diffusion coefficients control how fluctuations
of energy, momentum, and charge density dissipate in the system. The presence of a QCD critical point in
a heavy-ion collision should lead to enhanced fluctuations and strong correlations of conserved densities.
The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these small ripples under a realistic hydrodynamic flow background
elucidate the thermal, critical, and transport properties of the QGP. A new open-source theoretical
framework will be developed to decode this information from the measured multi-particle correlations.
This framework integrates the state-of-the-art 3D event-by-event QGP dynamics and the evolution of
generic fluctuations. By further combining the theoretical framework with advanced statistical analysis,
reliable phenomenological constraints on the QGP properties will be delivered when confronting the
precision measurements from the RHIC BES program. This research will benefit the current Beam Energy
Scan phase II and upcoming SPHENIX programs at RHIC, high luminosity runs at LHC, and the future
Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).

Precision Science and Control of Pellet Fueling for Optimizing Tokamak Plasma Scenarios
Dr. Daisuke Shiraki, Research and Development Staff Member
Fusion Energy Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge, TN 37831
Pellet fueling is an essential requirement for burning plasmas, where deep particle delivery is
required for fueling the fusion reaction occurring in the core. This change in primary fueling technology is
required as fusion experiments enter the burning plasma regime, where conventional fueling techniques
based on gas puffing are limited to the plasma edge, and will be replaced instead by cryogenic pellet
injection for central fueling. However, this change in fueling source also yields qualitative differences in
plasma behavior, with impacts on macroscopic stability and transport that affect other important aspects
of burning plasma control. A detailed understanding of these interactions is critical for the successful
integration of fueling needs with those of overall plasma performance. The goal of this proposal is to
develop and optimize pellet-fueling processes for controlling and sustaining the high-performance plasma
states required for ITER and other future burning plasma devices. This proposal will address several
outstanding issues for the successful integration of pellet fueling within the ITER research plan, including
magnetohydrodynamic stability and Edge-Localized Mode (ELM) control, and compatibility with divertor
plasma detachment. This experimental research will be carried out at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility,
and will be enabled by a number of significant upgrades to the DIII-D pellet injection system. Collectively,
this proposal provides capabilities for precisely controlling and quantifying pellet particle sources in the
plasma, as well as providing further increases to the available core particle source from pellets relative to
other sources such as neutral recycling. These will be utilized in precision experiments to probe the
impacts of pellet fueling on the desired plasma states, which must simultaneously exhibit high-
confinement, ELM control, and integration with an acceptable boundary plasma state. These experiments
will be coupled with theoretical modeling of the edge and boundary plasma under pellet-fueled conditions
to elucidate the interplay between particle sources, stability and transport, and the fueling process. This
understanding will be essential to the achievement of high-performance core-edge compatible regimes
that are required for ITER operations as well as for the mission of a US Fusion Pilot Plant.

The astrophysical evidence for dark matter and the profound questions in particle physics that
were highlighted by the discovery of the Higgs boson suggests that new fundamental particles and
interactions are awaiting discovery. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s most energetic particle
accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, will provide a
wealth of high energy collision data that will make it possible to search for evidence of new physics. A
hidden “dark sector” of particles that interacts very weakly with the Standard Model (SM) of particle
physics may be key to understanding the characteristics of the Higgs boson and the nature of dark matter.
Light dark sector particles that decay to known SM particles are predicted to be long-lived in many
theoretical scenarios of physics beyond the SM. This research program plans to utilize the data acquired
by the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment at the LHC to search for long-lived particles by
exploiting the capabilities of sensitive muon detectors and using artificial intelligence to develop novel
computational tools and methods to advance the studies. The research will investigate two possible
scenarios containing exotic physics signatures: (1) searches for low-mass, long-lived particles decaying
into muons and (2) hadronic showers involving decays of the Higgs boson that are identified in the CMS
detector’s muon system. Such searches will be complemented by designing and developing next-
generation electronics and firmware for a new CMS precision timing detector capable of ultra-fast timing
information to measure the trajectories of charged particles traversing the CMS detector. Ultimately, the
proposed program will enhance the physics capabilities during the future high-luminosity era of the LHC
and will be crucial in the detection of delayed signals from long-lived particles that can shed light on the
dark sector.

Orchestration for Distributed & Data-Intensive Scientific Exploration
Dr. Nathan Tallent, Computer Scientist
Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Richland, WA 99352
Scientific exploration and hypothesis generation is increasingly dependent on the convergence
of scientific modeling, data analytics, and machine learning. The result is data-intensive workflows that
are composed of multiple stages of computation and communication between distributed and
heterogeneous computing resources. Data movement is frequently the most significant bottleneck,
which is compounded by increasingly large data volumes. Our research objective is to enable workflows,
written in a variety of languages, that have production-like performance in massively distributed
environments with multiple computing paradigms. Our approach will develop techniques to orchestrate
data and tasks within distributed workflows. Our tools will generate workflow-specific execution
templates, based on data-centric execution analysis and modeling, that select data locations and layouts
for storage and memory that improve locality, reduce data movement overhead, and better use the
fastest data resources. The impact will be increased scientific capability due to improved workflow
performance.

AutoNeurify: Automatic Infusion of Learning in HPC Applications
Dr. Aditya V. Thakur, Assistant Professor
Department of Computer Science
University of California, Davis
Davis, CA 95616
High-performance computing (HPC) applications have become essential for scientific progress.
Computational methods for data collection and simulation are critical in making foundational
discoveries in nearly all scientific disciplines. HPC applications are also essential for addressing
humanity’s big problems, such as understanding and mitigating climate change, the energy crisis, and
for drug discovery. Consequently, scientific discovery can be accelerated by improving scientific
software by speeding up their execution, and lowering the expertise required by scientists to deploy and
maintain software. Recent research has shown the benefit of using machine learning to speed up HPC
applications. However, there is a significant burden on scientists to use machine learning. The project
develops AutoNeurify, an end-to-end system to automatically infuse learning in HPC applications.
AutoNeurify will enable scientists to improve the performance of HPC applications by using machine
learning in their problem-solving process while lowering expertise required for maintenance and
deployment, and avoiding hidden technical debt often found in real-world machine-learning systems.
This research was selected for funding by the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research.

Designing Molecular Interactions at the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Nitrogen Reduction
Dr. V. Sara Thoi, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
Johns Hopkins University
Baltimore, MD 21218
Nitrogen-containing compounds are industrially important species and are commonly used in
fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and polymeric resins. The Haber-Bosch process is the dominant method for
converting dinitrogen gas to ammonia, which is the primary feedstock for other nitrogen-containing
chemicals. However, the Haber-Bosch process is highly energy-intensive and requires both high
temperature and pressures. Electrochemical synthesis is an attractive approach for ambient dinitrogen
conversion. A robust electrocatalyst is typically needed to break the strong bond of dinitrogen, but
fundamental understanding on factors that promote high product selectivity and conversion is limited.
This research program will fill this knowledge gap by developing chemical strategies to catalyze the
conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia and other related chemicals. The objectives of this program are
focused on 1) tackling the poor selectivity, 2) improving the catalytic rate, and 3) generating valuable
commercial chemicals such as urea and acetamide. More broadly, strategies developed from this program
will facilitate the design of efficient electrocatalytic systems for the synthesis of chemical commodities
and alternative fuel sources.

Electron Beam Magnetic Field Mapping Technology for Undulators and Magnets
Dr. Marcos Turqueti, Electronics Research Engineer
Engineering Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley, CA 94720
This work will investigate an innovative magnetic field probe especially suitable but not limited to
the characterization of insertion devices for light sources such as undulators and wigglers. Examples of
such systems include the undulators planned for the Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), where a
complete magnetic characterization of the device is an integral part of its construction and certification.
Current magnetic field measurement technologies for such hardware include Hall Effect probes, wire-
based systems, and sensing coils. Hall Effect sensors are widely utilized for local field mapping and are the
technology of choice for most magnetic characterizations. Nevertheless, these sensors have limitations
such as direct current offset, nonlinearity, temperature drift, sensor aging, and the planar Hall effect. Their
long-term gain and output can change with time and temperature, requiring frequent recalibration. This
research proposes a paradigm shift, aiming to develop a novel sensing technology based on a micro–
Cathode Ray Tube (mCRT) integrated with an image sensor. This technology utilizes an electron beam that
emulates the actual beam traversing the undulator or magnet when in operation but with lower energy.
The mCRT shoots a stream of electrons at the imager, which is mounted perpendicularly to the beam and
located at the opposite end of the tube. Electrostatic lenses continually manipulate the electric field and
project a pattern onto the image sensor. This pattern is dependent on the magnetic environment present
at the beam path and can be translated into field measurements. With this unique approach, all limitations
inherent to Hall probes are eliminated and important advantages such as radiation hardness and
cryogenic operation are gained, thus resulting in a state-of-the-art magnetometer that will improve
magnetic metrology in the future.

HED magnetized plasma turbulence - Simulations, Experiments, and Theory
Dr. Petros Tzeferacos, Associate Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy and Laboratory for Laser Energetics
University of Rochester
Rochester, NY 14627
Magnetized turbulence is a key process in astrophysical phenomenology, and small-scale,
fluctuation dynamo action – the stretching, twisting, and folding of magnetic fields due to turbulent
motions – is currently our best working hypothesis to account for cosmic magnetic fields. Despite the
broad consensus among astrophysicists that magnetic field amplification via fluctuation dynamo is behind
the observed cosmic magnetism, the specifics of the process are still poorly understood and vigorously
debated. The reasons behind this state of affairs are that the mechanism eluded experimental
demonstration for decades, while theoretical and numerical studies have largely resorted to simplified
models that make the description of the process tractable. The advent of high-power laser systems and
the scaling of the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) have enabled a new field of high energy
density (HED) research in which astrophysical phenomenology is investigated through laser-driven
experiments. One such effort by the TDYNO (turbulent dynamo) Collaboration recently demonstrated
fluctuation dynamo for the first time in the laboratory, using the OMEGA laser at the Laboratory for Laser
Energetics (LLE) and guided by high-fidelity simulations performed with the FLASH code. Building on this
success, this research effort will holistically study HED magnetized turbulence in regimes where plasma
physics processes are important and go beyond the simplified approximations used in current theoretical
models and numerical simulations. This effort engages with the problem of HED magnetized turbulence
in a novel, two-pronged way: (1) High-performance computing (HPC) resources at the LLE and at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory will be leveraged to perform three-dimensional FLASH simulations of driven,
compressible, radiative magnetized turbulence and explore the properties of magnetized turbulence and
dynamo for realistic HED full-physics plasmas. (2) Then, building on the experimental achievements of the
TDYNO Collaboration, validated high-fidelity FLASH simulations will be used to design, execute, and
interpret laser-driven experiments that will experimentally demonstrate the properties of fluctuation
dynamo and magnetized turbulence in the plasma regimes charted by the driven-turbulence simulations.
This concerted effort combines theory, HPC simulations with FLASH, and experiments on our nation’s laser
facilities to establish a basis for laboratory astrophysics investigations on the nature of magnetized HED
turbulence and fluctuation dynamo.

Probing New Physics with Precision in the Higgs Sector at the Large Hadron Collider
Dr. Caterina Vernieri, Panofsky Fellow – Associate Scientist
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
Menlo Park, CA 94025
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics summarizes our current understanding of the
elementary constituents of matter and their interactions. Although most of its predictions have been
tested successfully to a high level of accuracy in a variety of scientific experiments, the model falls short
of being a complete theory of the fundamental interactions in the universe. The Higgs boson, discovered
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Switzerland, is the first fundamental scalar ever observed and thereby plays a unique role to probe the
SM and search for any direct experimental evidence for new particles and forces beyond the SM. This
research program plans to use data from the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment at the LHC to
advance the understanding of the Higgs sector that in turn will be distinct and complementary to proposed
future lepton colliders. The research aims to determine the Higgs boson self-coupling through a
simultaneous analysis of several Higgs measurements within the formalism of the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory, a model-independent interpretation of deviations that might appear in a wide
range of models beyond the SM. By applying modern machine learning computational techniques, the
studies will also address key measurements targeting double Higgs production at low di-Higgs invariant
mass as well as single Higgs production at large transverse momentum, both of which are crucial pillars of
the Higgs self-coupling and the broader LHC physics programs. Complementing these studies, future high-
luminosity runs at the LHC (HL-LHC) will critically depend on the performance of the ATLAS inner tracking
detector, and therefore, the program also involves developing a new silicon pixel tracker for the
experiment to exploit increased forward tracking acceptance that can enhance the phase-space for
precision Higgs boson measurements. The efforts will develop modular assembly procedures to
ensure that high-quality silicon-based devices are implemented in the new pixel tracker, while
simultaneously provide optimizations for the reconstruction of charged particles traversing
the tracker’s forward region. Such advances are expected to have deep impacts in the design of ultra-
sensitive particle instrumentation and technologies for use in future high radiation and dense collision
environments anticipated during the HL-LHC era.

Probing and Understanding the Spatial and Energy Distributions of Plasmonic Hot Carriers
via Single-Molecule Quantum Transport
Kun Wang, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy, Department of Chemistry
Mississippi State University
Mississippi State, MS 39762
The generation of non-equilibrium hot carriers in photoexcited plasmonic nanostructures leads
to unique light-matter interactions at the nanoscale and offers new transformative opportunities for a
range of applications, including photochemistry, solar energy harvesting, and optical sensing. Key to
making real use of these hot carriers lies in probing and understanding how ‘hot’ they are and where they
are spatially distributed on the surface of a plasmonic nanostructure. The goal of this research program is
to develop an experimental approach that enables systematic study of hot carrier distributions in a variety
of plasmonic nanostructures. This approach leverages quantum transport through single molecules to
access and probe plasmonic hot carriers. Specific objectives of this research include: (1) to probe the
steady-state spatial and energy distribution of hot carriers on noble metal nanostructures; (2) to gain
mechanistic insights into the geometric effect and material dependence of plasmonic nanostructures; (3)
to investigate local thermal effect associated with plasmonic excitation. This research will create
foundational knowledge that paves a path towards designing and engineering plasmonic nanodevices for
efficient and tunable hot carrier generation. The advances that emerge from this program also hold
promise for improving the efficiencies of many energy-related processes, including catalysis, solar cells,
and light detection.

Realizing the constraining power of galaxy clusters on cosmic acceleration: from DES to LSST
Dr. Hao-Yi Wu, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics
Boise State University
Boise, ID 83725
Why is the Universe accelerating? Is it caused by a cosmological constant, dynamic dark
energy, or modification of general relativity? For the first time in human history, we have telescopes
powerful enough to answer these questions. However, in recent years early- and late-Universe
experiments tend to disagree with each other. In particular, early-Universe experiments indicate larger
density fluctuations than late-Universe experiments if we assume general relativity is true. Does this
difference come from unknown physics or errors in our experiments?
This research will use galaxy clusters to address these issues. The number density vs. mass of
galaxy clusters reflects how cosmic density fluctuations evolve under the influence of cosmic
acceleration. This work will use gravitational lensing to accurately infer the mass of galaxy clusters and
cosmological parameters. In particular, this work aims to realize the enormous constraining power of
galaxy clusters from the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The
research team first plans to comprehensively understand the systematic errors in the current Dark
Energy Survey (DES) galaxy cluster data. The team will then apply the lessons learned from DES to
developing data analysis methods for LSST, both of which are DOE and National Science Foundation
partnerships. The proposed research will synergize with the galaxy cluster studies using NASA’s Roman
Space Telescope, paving the way for realizing the constraining power of current and next-generation
cosmology experiments.

New Synthetic Approaches Towards Atomically Precise π–d Conjugated Materials
Dr. Dianne Xiao, Assistant Professor
Department of Chemistry
University of Washington
Seattle, WA 98195
The discovery of carbon nanomaterials has led to transformative advances in a variety of sectors,
from energy storage and conversion to nanoscale electronics. Inspired by the exciting functional versatility
and fundamental physics observed in carbon-based conjugated materials, synthetic chemists have sought
to replicate these structural motifs in other material types. In particular, π–d conjugated metal–organic
frameworks, which are reminiscent of graphene, have attracted significant recent attention. However,
unlike carbon-based materials, which boast an incredible diversity of 0D, 1D, and 2D nanoallotropes, the
structural space of π–d conjugated frameworks remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to
address the nanoscale materials gap by developing bottom-up syntheses of atomically precise,
dimensionally reduced π–d conjugated materials. A complementary research thrust aimed at
understanding the formation mechanisms of π–d conjugated frameworks will take place alongside these
endeavors, guiding future efforts towards precise crystal size and morphology control. Together, this
multifaceted research program will address critical structure–property knowledge gaps and expand the
functional and structural scope of this exciting new class of conjugated nanomaterials.

Building a Framework to Understand Transition Metals’ Behavior in Euxinic Conditions
Dr. Jie Xu, Assistant Professor
Department of Geological Sciences
University of Texas, El Paso
El Paso, TX 79968
Euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic aqueous conditions) has played a critical role in sequestering transition
metals (TMs), from relatively abundant iron and manganese to strategically scarce cobalt and vanadium,
through geological time. A central question for illuminating TM transport and sequestration mechanisms
in euxinia is – how do the TMs react with aqueous sulfide produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in
complex low-temperature geochemical settings? The goal of this project is to address the existing gap
between our understanding of the structure, bonding, and speciation in transition metal sulfide species
and field observations of transition metal distributions. We approach this problem through laboratory
experiments using multiple analytical tools to reveal the underlying reaction mechanisms of TM-sulfide
systems and to connect the TM-sulfide interactions with the electronic states observed in TMs under
different solution conditions. The basic information to be obtained through this study will be critical for
understanding the evolution of euxinic geochemical environments and for developing relevant strategies
in resource recovery and environmental remediation. Additionally, the proposed study resonates strongly
with two emergent and high-impact research themes in geochemistry from incipient hypoxia in oceans
and local water bodies to the biogeochemical cycling of vanadium which has been increasingly added to
the atmosphere because of switching to the use of heavy oils, tar sands, and bitumen as combustion
sources worldwide.

Using ARM Data and Multiscale Models to Advance the Understanding of Liquid-Phase Cloud
Response to Aerosol Perturbation over Ocean and Land
Dr. Xue Zheng, Research Scientist
Cloud Processes Research and Modeling Group
Physical & Life Sciences Directorate
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Livermore, CA 94551
Aerosol particles in the atmosphere can affect the Earth’s climate directly by scattering or
absorbing radiation or indirectly by changing the properties of clouds (such as cloud particle size or cloud
lifetime). This “aerosol indirect effect” on liquid-phase clouds remains highly uncertain in present and
future climate scenarios. Qualifying the aerosol indirect effect in observations is challenging because
changes in cloud properties due to meteorological variations often mask out the cloud responses to
aerosol perturbations. In current climate models, the aerosol indirect effect tends to be overestimated
because the oversimplified physical representations of aerosol and cloud processes required to efficiently
simulate global climate in numerical models misrepresent the net effect of aerosol-cloud interactions
occurring at scales much finer than the model resolution. This project will use DOE’s long-term
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) observations, complemented by satellite retrievals and
numerical simulations, to study the aerosol indirect effect on liquid-phase clouds. This project will
untangle the aerosol-cloud interactions from the meteorological controlling factors by simultaneously
constraining multiple key large-scale conditions through matching and clustering, which will better detect
the aerosol indirect effect in observations. Furthermore, this project will conduct observationally
constrained large eddy simulations to identify how the cloud responses at small scales generate a net
aerosol indirect effect at scales that are relevant to the effective resolution of current and future climate
models. This project will bridge the gap between ARM observations and the DOE Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) via an emphasis on the process-level understanding and the causal discovery.
Overall, this work will advance our understanding of liquid-phase cloud processes crucial to aerosol-cloud
interactions in both observations and numerical models.

Data-driven Discovery of Inorganic Electrides for Energy Applications
Dr. Qiang Zhu, Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
University of Nevada Las Vegas
Las Vegas, NV 89154
Electrides represent a unique class of materials where excess electrons trapped inside crystal
cavities behave as anions. The trapped electrons are loosely bound near the Fermi energy level and can
be used to design new materials with low work functions or minimum thermodynamic work to remove
electrons from the solid, high electron mobility, and nontrivial band topology. However, despite the
rapidly growing interest in electrides by physicists, chemists, and materials scientists, electride research
has been hindered due to a lack of candidate materials. This research aims to accelerate the discovery of
electrides through developing an advanced materials screening method that combines group theory,
crystal structure prediction, machine learning, and high-throughput screening. Specific objectives of this
research include: (1) incorporating symmetry relations into materials structure screening, (2) developing
physics-informed machine learning models that can perform quick evaluations of materials’ structural and
electronic properties; and 3) constructing an electride database by screening promising material
structures within a large chemical space. The simulation results and database will provide the materials
science community with a large number of potential electrides, allowing the experimental community to
test these predictions and probe potential technological applications. These computational approaches
will be transferable across all classes of inorganic materials and may be utilized for a wide range of energy
research activities.
This research was selected for funding by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences and
